<p>As with primary productivity, carbon does not need to be explicitly simulated as a computed variable for these losses to occur, but because carbon is used as the units of accounting for phytoplankton biomass, its losses are computed by the WQ Module in order to report phytoplankton concentrations.

Figure L.2: <strong>Move the slider to see the effect of changing <span class="math inline">\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\)</span> on the form of the multiplicative factors preceding <span class="math inline">\([PHY]\)</span> in the above loss equations. <span class="math inline">\(R_{resp&lt;computed&gt;}^{phy}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_{exud&lt; computed&gt;}^{phy}\)</span> are set to fixed values of 0.1 and 0.05 /day, respectively</strong>

<p>Some key features of the Figures <a href="PhyLossC-4.html#fig:fig-PhyCloss1">L.1</a> and <a href="PhyLossC-4.html#fig:fig-PhyCloss2">L.2</a> are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(f_{true-resp}^{phy}\)</span> is set to 1.0, then carbonaceous excretion losses are due solely to exudation, and mortality losses are zero. This is consistent with interpreting <span class="math inline">\(f_{true-resp}^{phy}\)</span> as the fraction of respiration that is associated only with the re-release of energy through metabolism of carbon biomass generated and stored during antecedent phytoplanktonic photosynthesis</li>
<li>Conversely, if <span class="math inline">\(f_{true-resp}^{phy}\)</span> is set to 0.0, then (potentially unrealistically) respiration does not re-release any energy, but rather, sees the entire respiration rate expended on excretion of carbon biomass (subject to the value of <span class="math inline">\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\)</span>)</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\)</span> is set to 1.0, then mortality losses are zero. This is consistent with interpreting this parameter as the proportion of combined excretive and mortality losses that are excretive. The converse applies for a <span class="math inline">\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\)</span> of 0.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Intermediate behaviours to the above limits can be inferred through interacting with Figures <a href="PhyLossC-4.html#fig:fig-PhyCloss1">L.1</a> and <a href="PhyLossC-4.html#fig:fig-PhyCloss2">L.2</a>.</p>
