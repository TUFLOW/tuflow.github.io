<p>At each timestep and within each active computational cell, the WQ Module distributes the total FRP mass between dissolved FRP and adsorbed FRP if the phosphorus adsorption constituent model is used.

<p>The distribution between adsorbed and dissolved FRP concentrations is computed within the WQ Module via either a linear or quadratic model. These offer alternative approaches to simulating the distribution of total FRP between adsorbed and free states.</p>
