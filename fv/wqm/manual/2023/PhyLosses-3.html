<p>Once the respiration <span class="math inline">\(R_{resp\langle computed\rangle}^{phy}\)</span> and exudation <span class="math inline">\(R_{exud\langle computed\rangle}^{phy}\)</span> rates have been computed for a phytoplankton group via Equation <a href="PhyRates-3.html#eq:eq-pel-phy-resp">(I.6)</a> and Equation <a href="PhyRates-3.html#eq:eq-pel-phy-exud">(I.12)</a> respectively (and potentially Equation <a href="PhyRates-3.html#eq:eq-pel-phy-respSal">(I.7)</a> if salinity limitation is activated), then those rates drive the mass losses of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and silicate. These losses are computed using a number of user specified (or default) parameters, and for each relevant computed variable, comprise the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excretion loss: Computed from a combination of respiration and exudation rates (<span class="math inline">\(R_{resp\langle computed\rangle}^{phy}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_{exud\langle computed\rangle}^{phy}\)</span>, respectively), and</li>
<li>Mortality loss: Computed from the respiration rate <span class="math inline">\(R_{resp\langle computed\rangle}^{phy}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The specifics of the calculation of each relevant computed variable’s excretion and mortality are described following. Losses are denoted as fluxes, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.</p>

<p>As with primary productivity, carbon does not need to be explicitly simulated as a computed variable for these losses to occur, but because carbon is used as the units of accounting for phytoplankton biomass, its losses are computed by the WQ Module in order to report phytoplankton concentrations.

Figure L.2: <strong>Move the slider to see the effect of changing <span class="math inline">\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\)</span> on the form of the multiplicative factors preceding <span class="math inline">\([PHY]\)</span> in the above loss equations. <span class="math inline">\(R_{resp&lt;computed&gt;}^{phy}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_{exud&lt; computed&gt;}^{phy}\)</span> are set to fixed values of 0.1 and 0.05 /day, respectively</strong>

<p>Some key features of the Figures <a href="PhyLosses-3.html#fig:fig-PhyCloss1">L.1</a> and <a href="PhyLosses-3.html#fig:fig-PhyCloss2">L.2</a> are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(f_{true-resp}^{phy}\)</span> is set to 1.0, then carbonaceous excretion losses are due solely to exudation, and mortality losses are zero. This is consistent with interpreting <span class="math inline">\(f_{true-resp}^{phy}\)</span> as the fraction of respiration that is associated only with the re-release of energy through metabolism of carbon biomass generated and stored during antecedent phytoplanktonic photosynthesis</li>
<li>Conversely, if <span class="math inline">\(f_{true-resp}^{phy}\)</span> is set to 0.0, then (potentially unrealistically) respiration does not re-release any energy, but rather, sees the entire respiration rate expended on excretion of carbon biomass (subject to the value of <span class="math inline">\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\)</span>)</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\)</span> is set to 1.0, then mortality losses are zero. This is consistent with interpreting this parameter as the proportion of combined excretive and mortality losses that are excretive. The converse applies for a <span class="math inline">\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\)</span> of 0.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Intermediate behaviours to the above limits can be inferred through interacting with Figures <a href="PhyLosses-3.html#fig:fig-PhyCloss1">L.1</a> and <a href="PhyLosses-3.html#fig:fig-PhyCloss2">L.2</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>As for nitrogen and phosphorus losses, the key feature of Equations <a href="PhyLosses-3.html#eq:eq-pel-phy-Siexcr">(L.7)</a> and <a href="PhyLosses-3.html#eq:eq-pel-phy-Simort">(L.8)</a> is that if <span class="math inline">\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\)</span> is set to 1.0, then mortality losses are zero.

The converse applies for a <span class="math inline">\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\)</span> of 0.0</li>
<li>Despite not simulating particulate silicate, Equations <a href="PhyLosses-3.html#eq:eq-pel-phy-Siexcr">(L.7)</a> and <a href="PhyLosses-3.html#eq:eq-pel-phy-Simort">(L.8)</a> nonetheless ensure that the mass of silicate delivered to the dissolved pool (that is simulated by the WQ Module) is consistent with that of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.</li>
