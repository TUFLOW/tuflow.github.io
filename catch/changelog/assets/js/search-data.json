These interventions allow for the simulation of the removal of pollutants by stormwater treatment devices such as wetlands, bioretention swales, basins, buffer strips (as in the animation below) or other devices. Any number of interventions can be simulated across a catchment. The way in which pollutants are removed by an intervention is customisable, and information from external studies or modelling packages can be used to configure intervention performance. The TUFLOW CATCH User Manual describes how interventions can be implemented in detail. Error Reporting . Major Feature . Errors are now numbered, and are reported to screen and log file with URLs that point to more detailed error descriptions provided within the TUFLOW wiki as the 5XXX error series. Mass Balance . Support has been added to assess TUFLOW CATCH’s ability to conserve mass under all pollutant export models. Examples are provided in the TUFLOW CATCH User Manual under normal conditions, and when interventions are in place. Demonstration Model Suite . Two models have been added to the Demonstration model suite. These allow for the investigation of mass balance (_008) and provide templates for the implementation of interventions (_009). ",
