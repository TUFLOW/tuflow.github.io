These interventions allow for the simulation of the removal of pollutants by stormwater treatment devices such as wetlands, bioretention swales, basins, buffer strips (as in the animation below) or other devices. Any number of interventions can be simulated across a catchment. The way in which pollutants are removed by an intervention is customisable, and information from external studies or modelling packages can be used to configure intervention performance. The TUFLOW CATCH User Manual describes how interventions can be implemented in detail. Error Reporting . Major Feature . Errors are now numbered, and are reported to screen and log file with URLs that point to more detailed error descriptions provided within the TUFLOW Wiki: 5XXX error series. Mass Balance . Support has been added to assess TUFLOW CATCH’s ability to conserve mass under all pollutant export models. Examples are provided in the TUFLOW CATCH User Manual under normal conditions, and when interventions are in place. Demonstration Model Suite . Two models have been added to the Demonstration model suite. These allow for the investigation of mass balance (_008) and provide templates for the implementation of interventions (_009). ",

    "content": "Non Hydrologic Flows and Loads . Major Feature . Support has been added for the application of non hydrologic inflows of water and pollutants to a catchment hydraulic model domain. These allow for the simulation of environmental and other flows within a catchment domain that are not directly related to rainfall, including for example, wastewater treatment plant discharges, groundwater exfiltration or irrigation activities. These are affected using the familiar TUFLOW Source Area (SA) features, and the application of SA points, polylines and regions is supported. The TUFLOW CATCH User Manual describes how these sources can be implemented in detail. Example of using a point (green point) and polyline (green line) SA inflow and load. Selection of Catchment Hydraulic Model Soil Layers for Receiving Boundary Conditions . Major Feature . Support has been added to allow for selection of the catchment hydraulic model soil layers used to produce inflow boundary conditions to receiving models. For example, a user can specify that only the top 2 soil layers be used for production of downstream boundaries. This could avoid, for example, deep groundwater simulated in the catchment hydraulic model from being artificially forced into the surface receiving waterway as a boundary - in this example flows and loads in layers 3 and below will be excluded from the receiving boundaries and allowed to effectively bypass the downstream model. The TUFLOW CATCH User Manual describes how this feature can be implemented. Reporting of Fluxes Between Soil Layers . Major Feature . Support has been added to output the instantaneous and cumulative vertical fluxes of water and mass between soil layers included within the catchment hydraulic model. The water and mass entering a layer vertically from above is reported, allowing for full subsurface mass balance. The TUFLOW CATCH User Manual describes this output and how it can be implemented and interpreted. Example of vertical water flux into a catchment hydraulic model soil layer. Redder areas represent higher fluxes. Tutorials . Major Feature . Four TUFLOW CATCH tutorials have been developed and are available for use, licence-free. These cover all TUFLOW CATCH configurations and provide step by step instructions as to model setup, execution and interrogation. Supporting datasets are also provided. These are available on the TUFLOW Wiki. ",
