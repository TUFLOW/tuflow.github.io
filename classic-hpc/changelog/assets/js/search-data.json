    "content": "The TUFLOW 2025 release has changed the version numbering system. From the 2025 release and onwards, version numbering will use the year.minor.patch convention. The year corresponds to the major version number e.g. this release is 2025.0.0. Major releases are the only releases that will admit the possibility of implementing changes to defaults, making other breaking changes or affecting backwards compatibility. Advice will be provided on this in corresponding changelogs (e.g. the Backward Compatibility Section within this changelog). Throughout the year, additional minor releases (releases containing new features and bug fixes, but no breaking changes) would increment the minor version number (e.g. 2025.1.0) and bug fix only releases would increment the patch version number (e.g. 2025.0.1). The release notes that have previously accompanied each TUFLOW release have been replaced by a changelog (this document), which offers a more concise overview of the changes in each release. Any extra details or information are now added directly to the TUFLOW User Manual. Each major and minor TUFLOW release will have an accompanying TUFLOW User Manual. ",

    "title": "New Features and Enhancements",
    "content": "TUFLOW CATCH . Major Feature . Support has been added for TUFLOW CATCH integration. TUFLOW CATCH is a whole-of-catchment platform that can simulate hydrologic, hydraulic, pollutant export, and receiving waterway processes. TUFLOW CATCH is a separate executable, however relies on TUFLOW HPC functionality added in the 2025 release to simulate the catchment hydraulics. The TUFLOW CATCH User Manual contains information, examples, and demo models. Tracer Advection in TUFLOW 1D (ESTRY) . Major Feature . Tracer advection has been added to TUFLOW 1D (ESTRY). All channel types are supported, however only via the 2d_bc “SX” linking type. Dispersion of tracers, 1D source term, and 1D initial conditions are not yet supported. See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. SCS Infiltration . Major Feature . Support for the SCS infiltration method has been added to TUFLOW HPC (in addition to the already supported IL/CL, Green-Ampt, and Horton methods). SCS infiltration is widely used because of its simplicity and data availability. See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. HPC HQ Boundary Stability Default Value Change . The default value for the command HPC HQ Boundary Filter Constant (introduced in 2023-03-AD) has been changed to 5. This can provide improved stability for HQ boundaries. For backwards compatibility, set this to 1. Quadtree HQ Boundary Processing Optimisation . The HQ Boundary processing in Quadtree has been optimised so that models using HQ boundaries that select a large number of cells (along a single line) should see pre-processing speed ups. An example of this is where a single boundary line is snapped to the entire perimeter of the code polygon. In one test case, where the HQ boundary selected 3,900 cells, the pre-processing time went from 321 seconds to 5 seconds (roughly x50 speed up). SWMM: Additional Time Series Datasets . Discharges and cumulative volumes entering SWMM pipe networks from the 2D domain is now supported in the GPKG time series output written by TUFLOW for TUFLOW/SWMM linked models. Similar to ESTRY, negative discharges indicate that flow is surcharging from the pipe network into the 2D domain. See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. Support for Writing TINs to the SMS 2DM Mesh Format . Support has been added to write TINS to the SMS 2dm format instead of the SMS TIN format when using the command Read TIN Zpts or any of the Z-shape commands that create a TIN. The 2dm format can be read into QGIS in addition to SMS for viewing and editing. The 2dm is the default for the 2025 release. The following command can be used to specify the format used: . TIN Output Format == 2DM . New TIN Triangulation Method . Beta Functionality . A new TIN triangulation method ‘Method B’ has been implemented as a beta functionality. The current default method, ‘Method A’, distributes points along breaklines to encourage triangle edges along breaklines. Method B enforces breaklines, produces more balanced triangulations, and is more robust. This can be activated using the following command: . TIN Triangulation Approach == Method B . See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. New Timestepping Method for HPC . A new timestepping method has been developed that allows for larger timesteps in models that experience rapid wetting and drying. This method is the new default option. HPC Timestep Approach == Method B . See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. GPKG Write Optimisations . The writing of GeoPackage files has been sped up. The speedup will depend on the specific model and the users hardware (hard drive type, etc). The speedup is especially apparent for large check files such as _grd, _zpt, and _uvpt. Comparative testing between the 2023-03-AF and the 2025.0.0 builds has seen write times of 7 to 30 times faster. WIBU Retry Count Includes All License Types . The WIBU Retry Count setting will now loop through all license types when trying to find an available license. Previously, this only searched for BMT hardware licenses. SWMM: Prevent Unnecessary Error when Routing Time is Smaller than Report Step . When running a TUFLOW-SWMM model, the SWMM project file (inp) is passed to an embedded SWMM library. The project file includes a routing timestep. However, TUFLOW-SWMM simulations ignore the routing timestep and forces the SWMM model to adopt the TUFLOW timestep. While the routing timestep is not used, the SWMM library complains if it is larger than the report step. TUFLOW-SWMM models now force the routing timestep value sent to the library to be less than the report step preventing this unnecessary error. For example, the configuration in the image below would have caused an error in previous versions but is now automatically handled. New Option and Default Change for HPC DP Check . A “CHECK” option has been added to the HPC DP Check command and set as the new default. Specifying “ERROR” will apply the previous default, giving an error message and stopping the simulation if using TUFLOW HPC with the double precision (DP) executable. The “OFF” option can still be used to remove the check entirely. The double precision (DP) executable is generally slower than the single precision (SP) executable, however, applications such as long-term simulations and/or simulations with groundwater may require double precision for an accurate result. The single precision executable should be preferred for applications that do not necessitate using double precision. Include SWMM Messages on TUFLOW Wiki . SWMM ERROR/WARNING/CHECK messages have been verified and added to the TUFLOW Wiki: 6xxx TUFLOW Messages. Add ERROR if SWMM Node is Higher Than Inlet at The Same Node . It is invalid to have a node invert with a higher elevation than an inlet at the same node. ERROR 6024 is now issued when this occurs. Sink-Source Map Output in Quadtree . The Sink-Source (SS) map output has been added to Quadtree (this map output is already supported in Classic and HPC). Advection-Dispersion Output Enhancements . | Added support for AD check files inclusion / exclusion with the Write Check Files Include and Exclude options. For example, the .tcf command Write Check Files Exclude == ad grd will exclude both the AD (_ad_check) and the grid (_grd_check) check files. | Added support for AD mass output (Write Mass == ON in .adcf control file) when using TUFLOW HPC with Sub-Grid Sampling (SGS). Previously WARNING 4016 was issued and the AD Mass Output was disabled. | Added minimum and maximum AD concentrations for each tracer to screen output at each map output interval if using Verbose == ON .tcf option. | . Console Output and Behaviour Changes . | Removed some console output when reading data from NetCDF files (e.g. gridded rainfall or stress boundaries). This is removed to improve performance and reduce output clutter. This is still available by using the Verbose == ON .tcf option. | If TUFLOW is initialised with the “batch” command line argument (-b) and no input .tcf file is specified, the user input is no longer required after the licence check is performed. Previously, this would display “Press Enter to Release WIBU Licences”. This allows a check for, and release of, licences without needing user input. | . ",

    "title": "Bug Fixes",
    "content": "Domain Construction . | Fixed a should not be here - counter &gt;= mPoly error that could be triggered in Quadtree models when code polygons that contained holes existed within the hole of another code polygon. | Fixed a memory access violation error that would cause TUFLOW to crash during pre-processing if setting the initial groundwater level using either the Set IGW Depth or Set IGW Level commands without explicitly defining a layer number. | Fixed an issue where 2d_zsh polygons located outside of the 2D domain stopped the model during pre-processing with ERROR 2230. This has been downgraded to CHECK 2230 if the 2d_zsh polygon is entirely outside of the 2D domain. | When a merge polygon spreads across multiple Quadtree domains (e.g. nest levels), the merge polygon can apply an elevation of 99999 at some TIN vertices. This can cause incorrect geometry updates and can happen to Z Shape, FC Shape, Layered FC Shape, Variable Z Shape and Create TIN Zpt polygons that use the ‘Merge’ option. WARNING 2934 is now issued when at least one merge polygon vertex is located outside of a quadtree sub-domain and CHECK 2934 issued when at least one merge polygon vertex is located inside quadtree cells from a different nesting polygon. To avoid this, it is recommended to snap elevation points to every 2d_zsh polygon vertex if the polygon spans multiple Quadtree domains, or use the “NO MERGE” option and supply elevations as needed. | Added ERROR 2935 to stop simulations if no cell size was defined. | Added ERROR 2928 to stop simulations if it appears that a soils file (tsoilf) file is missing a comma between values (e.g. a line had 1, 0.6 0.3 where a comma is missing between 0.6 and 0.3). | Fixed an issue that could cause memory corruption when an empty (i.e. no geometry) 2d_qnl layer was used as an input in a Quadtree model. WARNING 2812 is written if an empty 2d_qnl is used. | Fixed a bug that could occur in Quadtree models run on CPU hardware, where TUFLOW attempted to pull infiltration results from GPU memory even if Hardware == CPU was specified. | . Boundaries and Links . | Fixed an issue with reading HEC-DSS files for boundary conditions (as described in the TUFLOW User Manual) when using Quadtree. Quadtree models previously reported ERROR: Internal error (number of values not allocated large enough in read_hecdss_file) and now work as expected. | Fixed an issue when a single QT or HT boundary line overlapped on itself in a Quadtree model that could incorrectly trigger ERROR 2030. | The application of global rainfall losses has been made consistent with material losses. There was a very slight discrepancy in how global rainfall losses were applied, as they were removed before the simulation started which meant the global losses were applied to the input rainfall timesteps, rather than the model timestep. If there was rainfall left over after losses were applied in a given timestep, the remaining rainfall was applied over the entire timestep. This resulted in decreased intensity over that timestep. | Fixed an issue where HQ boundaries that did not have a slope defined (‘b’ attribute left empty) would be automatically assigned a slope of 0.00001 in Quadtree models. Quadtree models with this set up now give ERROR 2017, consistent with TUFLOW HPC. | Fixed a stack overflow error that could occur when running a Quadtree model with a large number of HX connected cells. | Fixed an issue with 2d_sa inflows at streamlines (read in using Read GIS Stream) in HPC. When streamlines were specified, they were not being used (despite being in the _sac_check) files and flow was applied using the default SA approach (initially going to the lowest cell and then distributed between wet cells). If Read GIS SA Stream Only was specified this was working correctly. This issue did not affect Classic or Quadtree simulations. | Added ERROR 1462 to stop simulations if a 1D node is connected to both a SX and HX boundary. For backward compatibility this ERROR message can be downgraded to CHECK, using the Overlapping SX HX Boundary == CHECK command. | Added ERROR 1463 to stop simulations that use HX connections with the 1D Advection Dispersion (AD) module. HX connections are not supported in the 1D AD module. | . 1D Network Domains – EPA SWMM . | Added ERROR 6027 if no data is loaded from a SWMM input file and if the extension was not “.inp”. | Fixed an issue where using the Check INP Save Date == WARNING command could lead to an infinite loop if the GeoPackage file was newer than the .inp file. | Fixed an issue where an invalid SX connection was not giving an error. SX connections are only valid at outfall nodes or standalone nodes to convey subcatchment flows to a 2D domain. TUFLOW now gives ERROR 6009 for invalid SX connections. | . Outputs and Check Files . | Fixed an issue with XMDF outputs where datasets containing only small values had the minimums and maximums truncated to 0.0. | Fixed an issue where the “GW_Z” and “IGW” groundwater attributes and the “z_map_cutoff” attribute were missing from the grid check file when using Quadtree. These attributes are now included and the output is equivalent to HPC models. | Fixed an issue introduced in the 2023-03 release where some GIS check outputs were not being produced when running a TUFLOW-Flood Modeller simulation. The affected layers were: x1d_chans_check, x1d_nodes_check, xWLLo_check, and xWLLp_check. | Fixed an issue where the SWMM time-series output GPKG file was not producing the correct spatial indexes. This caused the file to not display correctly in QGIS, unless the spatial index was deleted and recreated. | Fixed a bug with GeoTIFF outputs that could cause an error when reading the output with GDAL (and potentially other GeoTIFF readers). The bug occurred if the GTCitationGeoKey was present in the referenced projection GeoTIFF (TIF Projection == &lt;path/to/reference.tif&gt;). The GTCitationGeoKey is now written correctly to the output GeoTIFF. | Fixed a bug where malformed characters would appear in the TUFLOW log file (.tlf) if the input boundary condition files had blank columns after the data. This did not impact model results. | Fixed an issue which could cause TUFLOW to crash with “access violation” if not using hazard outputs without using Materials for defining roughness (e.g. Set CnM). | Fixed an issue which could cause TUFLOW to crash if Write GIS Zpts was specified in the Geometry Control File (.tgc) when SGS was enabled. | Fixed an issue with the SMS Triangle output option not working if XMDF was the only map output data format specified. | Fixed a grid misalignment issue of the high-resolution (HR) output between the entire model and output zones. HR grids produced for output zones are now aligned with the entire model output. | Changed the message number for ‘Face elevations are NOT used in HR Grid Output’ from WARNING 3543 to WARNING 3560 due to a duplication. | Fixed a bug, which occurred only in Quadtree models, with the high-resolution (HR) DEM check file (_DEM_Z_HR) and HR depth output. This bug was introduced in the 2023-03-AA release, when water level lines (WLL) were incorporated in HR outputs. This bug does not affect hydraulic computations. | . GIS Formats . | Fixed an issue with the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) being written to GeoTIFFs. The change reduces the number of “Tags” in the TIFF header when information in the reference GeoTIFF does not include all geo-referencing information (previously empty tags were written). This change also removes duplicate tags. | Fixed an issue where GPKG outputs, check files, and log files were not being grouped into centralised databases if no check files were being written. | Fixed an issue where models using GPKG as the output GIS format could report ERROR 0636 during the simulation. This could be triggered if at some point during the pre-processing, CHECK 2470 was triggered (it has to be this specific check message). Then after that, the model wrote a lot of entries to the messages_P layer (e.g. over 100 entries). | Messages are no longer written immediately to the message output GIS layer during the simulation when using the GPKG output format. This reverses a change made in the 2023-03-AF build as it could cause slower run times when a lot of messages were being written during the simulation. | Fixed an issue that could cause TUFLOW to crash during pre-processing when an input attribute had over 1,000 characters (counted by combining all fields as a comma delimited string) and one of the attributes contained a line break. | Removed CHECK 0659 which could slow down pre-processing of layers that contained a lot of fields. | . Other . | Fixed an issue with the package model function where the TUFLOW External Stress Files (.tesf) were left out of the packaged files. These are now accurately retained. | Fixed an issue with the package model function where files referenced in ESTRY Network or Table Link layers were not processed if the layer was in a GeoPackage file already included. | Better support added for special characters such as ë. If in doubt, use UTF-8 encoding (note, not UTF-8 BOM) for files that contain any special characters. | Updated the BMT company name that is reported to the console and TUFLOW Log File (.tlf), to BMT Commercial. Previously, both BMT WBM or WBM Oceanics were used. | . ",

    "content": "The 2025.1.0 release is a minor release that contains a number of enhancements and bug fixes. The enhancements include updates to groundwater flow, HPC infiltration drying approach, and sheet flow in models using SGS. Note, many enhancements override existing methods and can cause changes in results. Therefore, they are not turned on by default in the 2025.1.0 release. This is to preserve backward compatibility (i.e. no changes in results) with previous 2025 releases. It is recommended that users consider using the new methods for new model builds, or for existing models where the new methods are appropriate and changes in results are acceptable. The recommended commands and their settings are: . | Groundwater Horizontal Flux Include Porosity == OFF | Groundwater Vertical Flux Model == Darcy's Law | 2 | HPC Infiltration Drying Approach == Method C | SGS Sheet Flow Approach == Method B | .

    "content": "Porosity Removed from the Groundwater Horizontal Flux Calculation . The option to remove the porosity term from the horizontal groundwater flux calculation has been added to HPC. Note ON is the default option in the 2025.1.0 release for backwards compatibility. Groundwater Horizontal Flux Include Porosity == OFF . Using Relative Saturation for Groundwater Flux . An option to reduce the groundwater flux based on the power function of relative saturation has been added to HPC. This feature can be applied to both the vertical flux and the horizontal flux, but the primary reason to implement this feature is to improve the timing of vertical infiltration in multi-soil layered models. The power exponent can be set globally by using the commands below by providing a second argument along side “Darcy’s Law”. A default value of zero (no adjustment) is used if no exponent is provided. See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. For models that specify one or two groundwater layer(s) for the root zone (0~1m deep), an Exv value of two was found to produce the best results in benchmarking tests. Groundwater Horizontal Flux Model == Darcy's Law | &lt;Exh&gt; Groundwater Vertical Flux Model == Darcy's Law | &lt;Exv&gt; . Soil Moisture Dependent Horizontal Conductivity . An option to apply van Genuchten (1980)’s soil moisture dependent function (in place of Darcy’s Law) to adjust the horizontal hydraulic conductivity has been added to HPC. This feature is designed to improve the performance of variably saturated flow (VSF) simulation through the vadose zone. See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. Additionally, the Groundwater Modelling webinar presents some of the testing and benefits of using a soil moisture dependent horizontal conductivity. Groundwater Horizontal Flux Model == Soil Moisture Dependent . New HPC Infiltration Approach . A new HPC infiltration drying approach has been added to HPC to improve the stability of direct rainfall models using soil infiltration. HPC Infiltration Drying Approach == Method C . This approach allows the infiltration to occur below the wetting depth (set by the Cell Wet/Dry Depth command), until the depth reaches the drying depth (defined as 0.0001 m below the wetting depth in HPC). This new method prevents cells from repeatedly alternating between dry and wet states when the applied rainfall rate is less than the infiltration rate, and can improve the stability in both SGS and non-SGS models. Note, the default approach is still Method A for non-SGS model and Method B for SGS models in the 2025.1.0 release for backwards compatibility. Enhancement to SGS Sheet Flow Approach . A new approach has been implemented to improve how sheet flow is handled in models using SGS. The new method can significantly improve the prediction of velocity magnitudes and direction for cells experiencing sheet flow. Note, it has been noticed that this command can affect the cell size convergence in direct rainfall models, therefore it is recommended to perform cell size sensitivity if using this command with Method B. The new approach is triggered by the command below: . SGS Sheet Flow Approach == Method B . Method B (the new method) checks whether cells in SGS models are being subjected to sheet flow conditions or not, and it will adjust the depth used in the bed friction calculation accordingly. Sheet flow conditions often occur in direct rainfall models on steep slopes where water can form a thin layer of flow. Method A (the default) assumes water fills up from the bottom of the cell, and will use the depth above minimum cell elevation in the bed friction calculation. Method B applies cell averaged depth for sheet flow cells instead to avoid the overestimation of the bed friction at these cells. Method B has also fixed an issue where the water level gradient limiter could be overestimated for SGS models in cells experiencing sheet flow. This could, in turn, affect the water surface gradient term in the momentum equation. Note, the new approach has minimal impact to non-sheet flow cells and Method A is still the default approach in the 2025.1.0 release for backwards compatibility. Improved Messaging for Legacy “Bed Resistance” Commands in TUFLOW HPC . Additional checks and messaging have been added for the following legacy “Bed Resistance” commands when using the HPC solver: . | Bed Resistance Cell Sides Only the default value is supported in HPC (Bed Resistance Cell Sides == Interrogate). ERROR 2320 is now reported if any other value is specified. | Bed Resistance Values Only the default value is supported in HPC (Bed Resistance Values == Manning n). ERROR 2320 is now reported if any other value is specified. | Bed Resistance Depth Interpolation This command is used in the HPC solver when calculating auto HQ curve boundaries. However, it is not used for interpolating between depths when using a depth varying Manning’s n, which will always be a linear interpolation in the HPC solver. WARNING 2937 is now reported if this command is used in HPC. | . ",

    "content": "Domain Construction . | Not a number (NaN) values in grid inputs are now always treated as “no data values”. Previously, NaNs anywhere in the grid input could lead to ERROR 2445. | . Boundaries and Links . | Fixed a bug when reading in a NetCDF rainfall grid that did not use the lower left corner as the origin. The origin is typically set by the software or service generating the NetCDF. In these cases, TUFLOW could incorrectly read the rainfall data depending on where the origin was set (the data would look flipped or mirrored if this was the case). | Fixed a bug where the d attribute representing the maximum depth for a generated HQ curve was being ignored when using the HPC solver. This value is now applied correctly allowing the user to extend HQ curves as needed. This did not affect Quadtree or Classic models. | Fixed a bug when reading rainfall CSV files that contained rows that were over 100,000 characters wide. This could potentially lead to missing data later in the simulation and cause ERROR 0141. | Fixed a bug where the HPC solver would report a runtime memory error when a GT boundary was used without activating the horizontal advection component of the groundwater flow (which is a requirement for GT boundaries to propagate water). WARNING 2936 is now reported during model initialisation in these situations and the GT boundary is not applied. | Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when using HEC-DSS boundaries in Quadtree models. The bug could be triggered when there were multiple boundaries, one of which was a HEC-DSS boundary with fewer than the maximum number of points. This bug could also cause an ERROR internal error to be reported, this message text has been changed to be should not be here to be consistent with other similar messages reported by TUFLOW. | . 1D Network Domains – External . | Fixed a bug when using a 1d_x1d layer in GPKG format that could incorrectly cause ERROR 0310 and ERROR 0253 | . 1D Network Domains – EPA SWMM . | Fixed a bug that could occur when a relatively large initial timestep was specified compared to the SWMM output interval. It is anticipated that the setup would only occur rarely since output intervals are typically much larger than timesteps. This situation is now handled appropriately. | Fixed a bug that caused TUFLOW-SWMM to fail to initialise with ERROR 6027 if pipe elevations were provided as “elevations” rather than “offsets” and the elevation values were below zero. This is not valid when using elevation offsets but valid when using absolute elevations. | . 1D Network Domains – ESTRY . | Fixed an issue where inactivated portions of a cross-section were used in conveyance calculations leading to decreases in conveyance with height and likely instabilities. | . Outputs and Check Files . | Fixed a bug where WLL TIN’s were not being generated correctly when the number of 1d_nwk + 1d_pit input layers exceeded 100. This limit has been removed except when using the command Meshparts == ON (meshparts is OFF by default). When meshparts is ON, the 100 input file limit is enforced with ERROR 1464. | Fixed a bug where long profile (2d_lp) plot output results tended to be stretched horizontally relative to the original lines. The methodology was updated so the distances in the plot and the line would track better. The issue was most noticeable for Quadtree models and LP lines that spanned multiple grid levels. | Fixed a bug where cells that remain dry throughout the simulation had a large negative value reported in the times output in the .tmo format, instead of a null value. | Fixed a bug with polygon gauge/receptor object outputs when using Quadtree. The tracked cell could incorrectly use the cell at the polygon centroid rather than the cell with the minimum elevation, causing the output trigger time to be at zero hours regardless of whether the cell was wet or not. | Fixed a bug with gauge/receptor object outputs that were using the USE ZC option and were situated within a nested area in Quadtree. The ZC value could be incorrectly taken from the level 1 domain, rather than the nested domain. | Added the Bug Fix - Soil Initial Moisture Equals or Exceeds Porosity from 2023-03-AF which was accidentally omitted from the release. | .
