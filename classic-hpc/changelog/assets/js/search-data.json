    "content": "The TUFLOW 2025 release has changed the version numbering system. From the 2025 release and onwards, version numbering will use the year.minor.patch convention. The year corresponds to the major version number e.g. this release is 2025.0.0. Major releases are the only releases that will admit the possibility of implementing changes to defaults, making other breaking changes or affecting backwards compatibility. Advice will be provided on this in corresponding changelogs (e.g. the Backward Compatibility Section within this changelog). Throughout the year, additional minor releases (releases containing new features and bug fixes, but no breaking changes) would increment the minor version number (e.g. 2025.1.0) and bug fix only releases would increment the patch version number (e.g. 2025.0.1). The release notes that have previously accompanied each TUFLOW release have been replaced by a changelog (this document), which offers a more concise overview of the changes in each release. Any extra details or information are now added directly to the TUFLOW User Manual. Each major and minor TUFLOW release will have an accompanying TUFLOW User Manual. ",

    "title": "New Features and Enhancements",
    "content": "TUFLOW CATCH . Major Feature . Support has been added for TUFLOW CATCH integration. TUFLOW CATCH is a whole-of-catchment platform that can simulate hydrologic, hydraulic, pollutant export, and receiving waterway processes. TUFLOW CATCH is a separate executable, however relies on TUFLOW HPC functionality added in the 2025 release to simulate the catchment hydraulics. The TUFLOW CATCH User Manual contains information, examples, and demo models. Tracer Advection in TUFLOW 1D (ESTRY) . Major Feature . Tracer advection has been added to TUFLOW 1D (ESTRY). All channel types are supported, however only via the 2d_bc “SX” linking type. Dispersion of tracers, 1D source term, and 1D initial conditions are not yet supported. See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. SCS Infiltration . Major Feature . Support for the SCS infiltration method has been added to TUFLOW HPC (in addition to the already supported IL/CL, Green-Ampt, and Horton methods). SCS infiltration is widely used because of its simplicity and data availability. See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. HPC HQ Boundary Stability Default Value Change . The default value for the command HPC HQ Boundary Filter Constant (introduced in 2023-03-AD) has been changed to 5. This can provide improved stability for HQ boundaries. For backwards compatibility, set this to 1. Quadtree HQ Boundary Processing Optimisation . The HQ Boundary processing in Quadtree has been optimised so that models using HQ boundaries that select a large number of cells (along a single line) should see pre-processing speed ups. An example of this is where a single boundary line is snapped to the entire perimeter of the code polygon. In one test case, where the HQ boundary selected 3,900 cells, the pre-processing time went from 321 seconds to 5 seconds (roughly x50 speed up). SWMM: Additional Time Series Datasets . Discharges and cumulative volumes entering SWMM pipe networks from the 2D domain is now supported in the GPKG time series output written by TUFLOW for TUFLOW/SWMM linked models. Similar to ESTRY, negative discharges indicate that flow is surcharging from the pipe network into the 2D domain. See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. Support for Writing TINs to the SMS 2DM Mesh Format . Support has been added to write TINS to the SMS 2dm format instead of the SMS TIN format when using the command Read TIN Zpts or any of the Z-shape commands that create a TIN. The 2dm format can be read into QGIS in addition to SMS for viewing and editing. The 2dm is the default for the 2025 release. The following command can be used to specify the format used: . TIN Output Format == 2DM . New TIN Triangulation Method . Beta Functionality . A new TIN triangulation method ‘Method B’ has been implemented as a beta functionality. The current default method, ‘Method A’, distributes points along breaklines to encourage triangle edges along breaklines. Method B enforces breaklines, produces more balanced triangulations, and is more robust. This can be activated using the following command: . TIN Triangulation Approach == Method B . See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. New Timestepping Method for HPC . A new timestepping method has been developed that allows for larger timesteps in models that experience rapid wetting and drying. This method is the new default option. HPCÃ‚Â TimestepÃ‚Â Approach == Method B . See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. GPKG Write Optimisations . The writing of GeoPackage files has been sped up. The speedup will depend on the specific model and the users hardware (hard drive type, etc). The speedup is especially apparent for large check files such as _grd, _zpt, and _uvpt. Comparative testing between the 2023-03-AF and the 2025.0.0 builds has seen write times of 7 to 30 times faster. WIBU Retry Count Includes All License Types . The WIBU Retry Count setting will now loop through all license types when trying to find an available license. Previously, this only searched for BMT hardware licenses. SWMM: Prevent Unnecessary Error when Routing Time is Smaller than Report Step . When running a TUFLOW-SWMM model, the SWMM project file (inp) is passed to an embedded SWMM library. The project file includes a routing timestep. However, TUFLOW-SWMM simulations ignore the routing timestep and forces the SWMM model to adopt the TUFLOW timestep. While the routing timestep is not used, the SWMM library complains if it is larger than the report step. TUFLOW-SWMM models now force the routing timestep value sent to the library to be less than the report step preventing this unnecessary error. For example, the configuration in the image below would have caused an error in previous versions but is now automatically handled. New Option and Default Change for HPC DP Check . A “CHECK” option has been added to the HPC DP Check command and set as the new default. Specifying “ERROR” will apply the previous default, giving an error message and stopping the simulation if using TUFLOW HPC with the double precision (DP) executable. The “OFF” option can still be used to remove the check entirely. The double precision (DP) executable is generally slower than the single precision (SP) executable, however, applications such as long-term simulations and/or simulations with groundwater may require double precision for an accurate result. The single precision executable should be preferred for applications that do not necessitate using double precision. Include SWMM Messages on TUFLOW Wiki . SWMM ERROR/WARNING/CHECK messages have been verified and added to the TUFLOW Wiki: 6xxx TUFLOW Messages. Add ERROR if SWMM Node is Higher Than Inlet at The Same Node . It is invalid to have a node invert with a higher elevation than an inlet at the same node. ERROR 6024 is now issued when this occurs. Sink-Source Map Output in Quadtree . The Sink-Source (SS) map output has been added to Quadtree (this map output is already supported in Classic and HPC). Advection-Dispersion Output Enhancements . | Added support for AD check files inclusion / exclusion with the Write Check Files Include and Exclude options. For example, the .tcf command Write Check Files Exclude == ad grd will exclude both the AD (_ad_check) and the grid (_grd_check) check files. | Added support for AD mass output (Write Mass == ON in .adcf control file) when using TUFLOW HPC with Sub-Grid Sampling (SGS). Previously WARNING 4016 was issued and the AD Mass Output was disabled. | Added minimum and maximum AD concentrations for each tracer to screen output at each map output interval if using Verbose == ON .tcf option. | . Console Output and Behaviour Changes . | Removed some console output when reading data from NetCDF files (e.g. gridded rainfall or stress boundaries). This is removed to improve performance and reduce output clutter. This is still available by using the Verbose == ON .tcf option. | If TUFLOW is initialised with the “batch” command line argument (-b) and no input .tcf file is specified, the user input is no longer required after the licence check is performed. Previously, this would display “Press Enter to Release WIBU Licences”. This allows a check for, and release of, licences without needing user input. | . ",

    "content": "Domain Construction . | Fixed a should not be here - counter &gt;= mPoly error that could be triggered in Quadtree models when code polygons that contained holes existed within the hole of another code polygon. | Fixed a memory access violation error that would cause TUFLOW to crash during pre-processing if setting the initial groundwater level using either the Set IGW Depth or Set IGW Level commands without explicitly defining a layer number. | Fixed an issue where 2d_zsh polygons located outside of the 2D domain stopped the model during pre-processing with ERROR 2230. This has been downgraded to CHECK 2230 if the 2d_zsh polygon is entirely outside of the 2D domain. | When a merge polygon spreads across multiple Quadtree domains (e.g. nest levels), the merge polygon can apply an elevation of 99999 at some TIN vertices. This can cause incorrect geometry updates and can happen to Z Shape, FC Shape, Layered FC Shape, Variable Z Shape and Create TIN Zpt polygons that use the ‘Merge’ option. WARNING 2934 is now issued when at least one merge polygon vertex is located outside of a quadtree sub-domain and CHECK 2934 issued when at least one merge polygon vertex is located inside quadtree cells from a different nesting polygon. To avoid this, it is recommended to snap elevation points to every 2d_zsh polygon vertex if the polygon spans multiple Quadtree domains, or use the “NO MERGE” option and supply elevations as needed. | Added ERROR 2935 to stop simulations if no cell size was defined. | Added ERROR 2928 to stop simulations if it appears that a soils file (tsoilf) file is missing a comma between values (e.g. a line had 1, 0.6 0.3 where a comma is missing between 0.6 and 0.3). | Fixed an issue that could cause memory corruption when an empty (i.e. no geometry) 2d_qnl layer was used as an input in a Quadtree model. WARNING 2812 is written if an empty 2d_qnl is used. | Fixed a bug that could occur in Quadtree models run on CPU hardware, where TUFLOW attempted to pull infiltration results from GPU memory even if Hardware == CPU was specified. | . Boundaries and Links . | Fixed an issue with reading HEC-DSS files for boundary conditions (as described in the TUFLOW User Manual) when using Quadtree. Quadtree models previously reported ERROR: Internal error (number of values not allocated large enough in read_hecdss_file) and now work as expected. | Fixed an issue when a single QT or HT boundary line overlapped on itself in a Quadtree model that could incorrectly trigger ERROR 2030. | The application of global rainfall losses has been made consistent with material losses. There was a very slight discrepancy in how global rainfall losses were applied, as they were removed before the simulation started which meant the global losses were applied to the input rainfall timesteps, rather than the model timestep. If there was rainfall left over after losses were applied in a given timestep, the remaining rainfall was applied over the entire timestep. This resulted in decreased intensity over that timestep. | Fixed an issue where HQ boundaries that did not have a slope defined (‘b’ attribute left empty) would be automatically assigned a slope of 0.00001 in Quadtree models. Quadtree models with this set up now give ERROR 2017, consistent with TUFLOW HPC. | Fixed a stack overflow error that could occur when running a Quadtree model with a large number of HX connected cells. | Fixed an issue with 2d_sa inflows at streamlines (read in using Read GIS Stream) in HPC. When streamlines were specified, they were not being used (despite being in the _sac_check) files and flow was applied using the default SA approach (initially going to the lowest cell and then distributed between wet cells). If Read GIS SA Stream Only was specified this was working correctly. This issue did not affect Classic or Quadtree simulations. | Added ERROR 1462 to stop simulations if a 1D node is connected to both a SX and HX boundary. For backward compatibility this ERROR message can be downgraded to CHECK, using the Overlapping SX HX Boundary == CHECK command. | Added ERROR 1463 to stop simulations that use HX connections with the 1D Advection Dispersion (AD) module. HX connections are not supported in the 1D AD module. | . 1D Network Domains – EPA SWMM . | Added ERROR 6027 if no data is loaded from a SWMM input file and if the extension was not “.inp”. | Fixed an issue where using the Check INP Save Date == WARNING command could lead to an infinite loop if the GeoPackage file was newer than the .inp file. | Fixed an issue where an invalid SX connection was not giving an error. SX connections are only valid at outfall nodes or standalone nodes to convey subcatchment flows to a 2D domain. TUFLOW now gives ERROR 6009 for invalid SX connections. | . Outputs and Check Files . | Fixed an issue with XMDF outputs where datasets containing only small values had the minimums and maximums truncated to 0.0. | Fixed an issue where the “GW_Z” and “IGW” groundwater attributes and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“z_map_cutoffÃ¢â‚¬Â attribute were missing from the grid check file when using Quadtree. These attributes are now included and the output is equivalent to HPC models. | Fixed an issue introduced in the 2023-03 release where some GIS check outputs were not being produced when running a TUFLOW-Flood Modeller simulation. The affected layers were: x1d_chans_check, x1d_nodes_check, xWLLo_check, and xWLLp_check. | Fixed an issue where the SWMM time-series output GPKG file was not producing the correct spatial indexes. This caused the file to not display correctly in QGIS, unless the spatial index was deleted and recreated. | Fixed a bug with GeoTIFF outputs that could cause an error when reading the output with GDAL (and potentially other GeoTIFF readers). The bug occurred if the GTCitationGeoKey was present in the referenced projection GeoTIFF (TIF Projection == &lt;path/to/reference.tif&gt;). The GTCitationGeoKey is now written correctly to the output GeoTIFF. | Fixed a bug where malformed characters would appear in the TUFLOW log file (.tlf) if the input boundary condition files had blank columns after the data. This did not impact model results. | Fixed an issue which could cause TUFLOW to crash with “access violation” if not using hazard outputs without using Materials for defining roughness (e.g. Set CnM). | Fixed an issue which could cause TUFLOW to crash if Write GIS Zpts was specified in the Geometry Control File (.tgc) when SGS was enabled. | Fixed an issue with the SMS Triangle output option not working if XMDF was the only map output data format specified. | Fixed a grid misalignment issue of the high-resolution (HR) output between the entire model and output zones. HR grids produced for output zones are now aligned with the entire model output. | Changed the message number for ‘Face elevations are NOT used in HR Grid Output’ from WARNING 3543 to WARNING 3560 due to a duplication. | Fixed a bug, which occurred only in Quadtree models, with the high-resolution (HR) DEM check file (_DEM_Z_HR) and HR depth output. This bug was introduced in the 2023-03-AA release, when water level lines (WLL) were incorporated in HR outputs. This bug does not affect hydraulic computations. | . GIS Formats . | Fixed an issue with the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) being written to GeoTIFFs. The change reduces the number of “Tags” in the TIFF header when information in the reference GeoTIFF does not include all geo-referencing information (previously empty tags were written). This change also removes duplicate tags. | Fixed an issue where GPKG outputs, check files, and log files were not being grouped into centralised databases if no check files were being written. | Fixed an issue where models using GPKG as the output GIS format could report ERROR 0636 during the simulation. This could be triggered if at some point during the pre-processing, CHECK 2470 was triggered (it has to be this specific check message). Then after that, the model wrote a lot of entries to the messages_P layer (e.g. over 100 entries). | Messages are no longer written immediately to the message output GIS layer during the simulation when using the GPKG output format. This reverses a change made in the 2023-03-AF build as it could cause slower run times when a lot of messages were being written during the simulation. | Fixed an issue that could cause TUFLOW to crash during pre-processing when an input attribute had over 1,000 characters (counted by combining all fields as a comma delimited string) and one of the attributes contained a line break. | Removed CHECK 0659 which could slow down pre-processing of layers that contained a lot of fields. | . Other . | Fixed an issue with the package model function where the TUFLOW External Stress Files (.tesf) were left out of the packaged files. These are now accurately retained. | Fixed an issue with the package model function where files referenced in ESTRY Network or Table Link layers were not processed if the layer was in a GeoPackage file already included. | Better support added for special characters such as ÃƒÂ«. If in doubt, use UTF-8 encoding (note, not UTF-8 BOM) for files that contain any special characters. | Updated the BMT company name that is reported to the console and TUFLOW Log File (.tlf), to BMT Commercial. Previously, both BMT WBM or WBM Oceanics were used. | . ",

    "content": "The 2025.1.0 release is a minor release that contains a number of enhancements and bug fixes. The enhancements include updates to groundwater flow, HPC infiltration drying approach, and sheet flow in models using SGS. Note, many enhancements override existing methods and can cause changes in results. Therefore, they are not turned on by default in the 2025.1.0 release. This is to preserve backward compatibility (i.e. no changes in results) with previous 2025 releases. It is recommended that users consider using the new methods for new model builds, or for existing models where the new methods are appropriate and changes in results are acceptable. The recommended commands and their settings are: . | Groundwater Horizontal Flux Include Porosity == OFF | Groundwater Vertical Flux Model == Darcy's Law | 2 | HPC Infiltration Drying Approach == Method C | SGS Sheet Flow Approach == Method B | .

    "title": "New Features and Enhancements",
    "content": "Porosity Removed from the Groundwater Horizontal Flux Calculation . The option to remove the porosity term from the horizontal groundwater flux calculation has been added to HPC. Note ON is the default option in the 2025.1.0 release for backwards compatibility. Groundwater Horizontal Flux Include Porosity == OFF . Using Relative Saturation for Groundwater Flux . An option to reduce the groundwater flux based on the power function of relative saturation has been added to HPC. This feature can be applied to both the vertical flux and the horizontal flux, but the primary reason to implement this feature is to improve the timing of vertical infiltration in multi-soil layered models. The power exponent can be set globally by using the commands below by providing a second argument along side “Darcy’s Law”. A default value of zero (no adjustment) is used if no exponent is provided. See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. For models that specify one or two groundwater layer(s) for the root zone (0~1m deep), an Exv value of two was found to produce the best results in benchmarking tests. Groundwater Horizontal Flux Model == Darcy's Law | &lt;Exh&gt; Groundwater Vertical Flux Model == Darcy's Law | &lt;Exv&gt; . Soil Moisture Dependent Horizontal Conductivity . An option to apply van Genuchten (1980)’s soil moisture dependent function (in place of Darcy’s Law) to adjust the horizontal hydraulic conductivity has been added to HPC. This feature is designed to improve the performance of variably saturated flow (VSF) simulation through the vadose zone. See the TUFLOW User Manual for more information. Additionally, the Groundwater Modelling webinar presents some of the testing and benefits of using a soil moisture dependent horizontal conductivity. Groundwater Horizontal Flux Model == Soil Moisture Dependent . New HPC Infiltration Approach . A new HPC infiltration drying approach has been added to HPC to improve the stability of direct rainfall models using soil infiltration. HPC Infiltration Drying Approach == Method C . This approach allows the infiltration to occur below the wetting depth (set by the Cell Wet/Dry Depth command), until the depth reaches the drying depth (defined as 0.0001 m below the wetting depth in HPC). This new method prevents cells from repeatedly alternating between dry and wet states when the applied rainfall rate is less than the infiltration rate, and can improve the stability in both SGS and non-SGS models. Note, the default approach is still Method A for non-SGS model and Method B for SGS models in the 2025.1.0 release for backwards compatibility. Enhancement to SGS Sheet Flow Approach . A new approach has been implemented to improve how sheet flow is handled in models using SGS. The new method can significantly improve the prediction of velocity magnitudes and direction for cells experiencing sheet flow. Note, it has been noticed that this command can affect the cell size convergence in direct rainfall models, therefore it is recommended to perform cell size sensitivity if using this command with Method B. The new approach is triggered by the command below: . SGS Sheet Flow Approach == Method B . Method B (the new method) checks whether cells in SGS models are being subjected to sheet flow conditions or not, and it will adjust the depth used in the bed friction calculation accordingly. Sheet flow conditions often occur in direct rainfall models on steep slopes where water can form a thin layer of flow. Method A (the default) assumes water fills up from the bottom of the cell, and will use the depth above minimum cell elevation in the bed friction calculation. Method B applies cell averaged depth for sheet flow cells instead to avoid the overestimation of the bed friction at these cells. Method B has also fixed an issue where the water level gradient limiter could be overestimated for SGS models in cells experiencing sheet flow. This could, in turn, affect the water surface gradient term in the momentum equation. Note, the new approach has minimal impact to non-sheet flow cells and Method A is still the default approach in the 2025.1.0 release for backwards compatibility. Improved Messaging for Legacy “Bed Resistance” Commands in TUFLOW HPC . Additional checks and messaging have been added for the following legacy “Bed Resistance” commands when using the HPC solver: . | Bed Resistance Cell Sides Only the default value is supported in HPC (Bed Resistance Cell Sides == Interrogate). ERROR 2320 is now reported if any other value is specified. | Bed Resistance Values Only the default value is supported in HPC (Bed Resistance Values == Manning n). ERROR 2320 is now reported if any other value is specified. | Bed Resistance Depth Interpolation This command is used in the HPC solver when calculating auto HQ curve boundaries. However, it is not used for interpolating between depths when using a depth varying Manning’s n, which will always be a linear interpolation in the HPC solver. WARNING 2937 is now reported if this command is used in HPC. | . ",

Previously, NaNs anywhere in the grid input could lead to ERROR 2445. | . Boundaries and Links . | Fixed a bug when reading in a NetCDF rainfall grid that did not use the lower left corner as the origin. The origin is typically set by the software or service generating the NetCDF. In these cases, TUFLOW could incorrectly read the rainfall data depending on where the origin was set (the data would look flipped or mirrored if this was the case). | Fixed a bug where the d attribute representing the maximum depth for a generated HQ curve was being ignored when using the HPC solver. This value is now applied correctly allowing the user to extend HQ curves as needed. This did not affect Quadtree or Classic models. | Fixed a bug when reading rainfall CSV files that contained rows that were over 100,000 characters wide. This could potentially lead to missing data later in the simulation and cause ERROR 0141. | Fixed a bug where the HPC solver would report a runtime memory error when a GT boundary was used without activating the horizontal advection component of the groundwater flow (which is a requirement for GT boundaries to propagate water). WARNING 2936 is now reported during model initialisation in these situations and the GT boundary is not applied. | Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when using HEC-DSS boundaries in Quadtree models. The bug could be triggered when there were multiple boundaries, one of which was a HEC-DSS boundary with fewer than the maximum number of points. This bug could also cause an ERROR internal error to be reported, this message text has been changed to be should not be here to be consistent with other similar messages reported by TUFLOW. | . 1D Network Domains – External . | Fixed a bug when using a 1d_x1d layer in GPKG format that could incorrectly cause ERROR 0310 and ERROR 0253 | . 1D Network Domains – EPA SWMM . | Fixed a bug that could occur when a relatively large initial timestep was specified compared to the SWMM output interval. It is anticipated that the setup would only occur rarely since output intervals are typically much larger than timesteps. This situation is now handled appropriately. | Fixed a bug that caused TUFLOW-SWMM to fail to initialise with ERROR 6027 if pipe elevations were provided as “elevations” rather than “offsets” and the elevation values were below zero. This is not valid when using elevation offsets but valid when using absolute elevations. | . 1D Network Domains – ESTRY . | Fixed an issue where inactivated portions of a cross-section were used in conveyance calculations leading to decreases in conveyance with height and likely instabilities. | . Outputs and Check Files . | Fixed a bug where WLL TIN’s were not being generated correctly when the number of 1d_nwk + 1d_pit input layers exceeded 100. This limit has been removed except when using the command Meshparts == ON (meshparts is OFF by default). When meshparts is ON, the 100 input file limit is enforced with ERROR 1464. | Fixed a bug where long profile (2d_lp) plot output results tended to be stretched horizontally relative to the original lines. The methodology was updated so the distances in the plot and the line would track better. The issue was most noticeable for Quadtree models and LP lines that spanned multiple grid levels. | Fixed a bug where cells that remain dry throughout the simulation had a large negative value reported in the times output in the .tmo format, instead of a null value. | Fixed a bug with polygon gauge/receptor object outputs when using Quadtree. The tracked cell could incorrectly use the cell at the polygon centroid rather than the cell with the minimum elevation, causing the output trigger time to be at zero hours regardless of whether the cell was wet or not. | Fixed a bug with gauge/receptor object outputs that were using the USE ZC option and were situated within a nested area in Quadtree. The ZC value could be incorrectly taken from the level 1 domain, rather than the nested domain. | Added the Bug Fix - Soil Initial Moisture Equals or Exceeds Porosity from 2023-03-AF which was accidentally omitted from the release. | .

    "content": "Mathematical Operations in Control Files . Support has been added for mathematical operations within TUFLOW control files using the ExprTK library. This allows users to write mathematical expressions to create more succinct and procedural control files (see examples below). Expressions include basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /), as well as more advanced functions such as trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions (among other more complex flow controls). See the TUFLOW User Manual for more details. Simple example of using mathematical operations to procedurally set the rainfall losses from a single set of design losses based on landuse type. Example of using mathematical operations, including the \"round\" function, to procedurally set the model end time and map output interval based on the storm duration.Note, the \"max\" function could also be used to ensure the \"MAP_OUTPUT_INTERVAL\" expression does not evaluate to zero. Groundwater (2D) Linking to 1D (ESTRY or SWMM) . It is now possible to connect a 1D domain (either ESTRY or SWMM) to 2D groundwater layers to represent subsurface drainage or groundwater recharge. This enables the ability to model features such as detention basins with subsurface drainage or other green infrastructure directly within a TUFLOW model and represent groundwater and surface water impacts. See the TUFLOW User Manual for more details. SWMM GPKG Time-Series Output Moved to Plot Subfolder for Consistency . The SWMM GPKG time-series output (_swmm_ts.gpkg) file has been moved to the “plot” subfolder to be consistent with other time-series results. A reference to the file has also been added to the tpc file. The development version of the TUFLOW Viewer in QGIS supports loading the SWMM time-series output from the tpc with the other time-series results. This functionality will be in the next update of the TUFLOW plugin. See the TUFLOW User Manual for more details. 1D Arch Bridge Channel: Positive “HConF_or_WC” Value Triggers Orifice Flow . A positive HConF_or_WC value can now be used to activate the transition to orifice flow in 1D arch bridge channels (BArch type). If a positive value is specified, the HConF_or_WC is used to set the orifice flow discharge coefficient Cd. For example, setting HConF_or_WC to 0.799 (the recommended value) sets the value of Cd directly (i.e. Cd = 0.799). Previously, a negative HConF_or_WC was needed to activate the transition to orifice flow. This method is still available, however, note that if HConF_or_WC is negative, the absolute value of HConF_or_WC is used as a calibration factor in the orifice flow equation. For example, with this approach, the base Cd value is automatically set as 0.799, therefore the final discharge coefficient is calculated as Cd = abs(calibration_coefficient) * 0.799. 1D Arch Bridge Channel: Additional Check File Attributes . The final Cd value used for orifice flow and the start and finish transition elevations are now output to the nwk_C_check_L file. ",

    "content": "Domain Construction . | Further updates to process a merge polygon that spreads across multiple Quadtree domains (e.g. nest levels). During Quadtree pre-processing, TUFLOW constructs a Quadtree mesh for each nest level, but only updates the ZC/ZU/ZV/ZH elevations in the final Quadtree mesh. For the “hidden” Quadtree mesh illustrated in the image below, the elevations were not being updated. A fix has been made to update both the “hidden” and “active” Quadtree meshes. After this change, a merge polygon that spreads across multiple Quadtree domains can use the elevations from the “hidden” ZC/ZU/ZV/ZH points for merging elevations. This reduces the risk of applying unexpected elevation at the tin vertices of a merge polygon. However, since users are not able to see the elevations used for merging, CHECK 2934 is still issued, and it is recommended to check the final elevation from the zsh_zpt and DEM_Z check files. | Fixed a rare domain decomposition bug in large Quadtree models that run on multiple GPU/CPU devices. An extremely large number of cells can cause a rounding error during domain decomposition and send a small number of cells to a device that is not requested by the model. This process is now done in double precision in order to avoid this error. | WARNING 2938 is now generated if a cyclone boundary is used in HPC and the HPC Cyclone Boundary Update Interval command is not present. | Fixed a memory access error for the high resolution DEM_Z check file if both the HR Thin Z Line Output Adjustment == ON ALIGNMENT option and 1D WLL outputs are used. | .

    "content": "Boundaries and Links . | Fixed an issue with the TUFLOW HPC / FV interface cells in a TUFLOW CATCH model which could cause the groundwater to be drained too fast from the HPC model. Zero groundwater depth was being applied at the interface cells, which could generate an artificial drawdown of the groundwater level. A “free outflow” boundary is now implemented at the TUFLOW HPC / FV interface, where the gradients of groundwater velocity and groundwater pressure level are assumed to be zero. This type of boundary allows groundwater to flow out of the model ‘freely’ without causing artificial drawdown or blockage. | Fixed an issue in TUFLOW HPC where cyclone boundaries were not being updated if the HPC Cyclone Boundary Update Interval command was not present. Without this command, the centre of a cyclone stayed at the first vertex of the 2d_cyc polyline. After the fix, the cyclone will now step from vertex to vertex along the 2d_cyc polyline. However, it is strongly recommended to use the HPC Cyclone Boundary Update Interval command in order to update the cyclone location smoothly. | Fixed an issue where reading boundary condition curve data from HEC-DSS Boundary Files was generating incorrect boundary curves. The bug was introduced in 2025.1 and appeared to apply to all curves read from a HEC-DSS file, incorrectly generating a simple increasing curve. | . Outputs and Check Files . | WARNING 2386 is now generated if Map Output Data Types includes the RC type when using the HPC solver. Note, that evacuation routes in an HPC model support the _RCP GIS output, but the RC map output is currently only supported in TUFLOW Classic. | .

This has been a key focus of the development team for the last 12 months (and has been underway in some capacity for much longer). The Linux build supports all TUFLOW Classic and HPC features and should produce equivalent results to the Windows build. Other key features include a new self-contained GeoPackage time-series format, the ability to specify a different surcharging discharge relationship for ESTRY “Q” type pits, the use of GDAL drivers, and many more items.

    "title": "New Features and Enhancements",
    "content": "Linux Release . A Linux build is now available for TUFLOW Classic and HPC, and both .deb and .rpm packages are available. The Linux build has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and Rocky 9. All features of TUFLOW Classic and HPC are supported in the Linux build, producing results equivalent to the Windows version. To install the beta version, download the appropriate package for the Linux distribution from the TUFLOW Downloads page and install the package using the appropriate package manager for the distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, the TUFLOW 2026 beta can be installed using the following command in the terminal (making sure to use the correct path to the downloaded .deb file): . sudo apt install ./tuflow_2026.0.0~beta.2-1_amd64.deb . It is also a temporary requirement for the beta release to set the stack size limit to unlimited when running TUFLOW on Linux. This can be done with the following command in the terminal: . ulimit -s unlimited . Linux file systems are typically case-sensitive, while Windows file systems are generally case-insensitive. This may cause problems when copying models built on Windows. A new command line argument has been added to allow TUFLOW on Linux to be less sensitive to the case in referenced file paths. This can be enabled with the following command -cs[level] where the level can be set to: . | 0 - Strict (default) | 1 - Case-insensitive file extension - this applies only to the file extensions | 2 - Case-insensitive filename - this applies to both the file name and extension but not directory components of the path. | . For example, the following command runs the TUFLOW example model EG00_001.tcf with case-insensitivity enabled: . /opt/tuflow/bin/tuflow_2026.0/tuflow-isp -cs2 ./runs/EG00_001.tcf . Note, on Linux TUFLOW will automatically interpret backslashes as forward slashes when processing file paths referenced in the control files. GeoPackage Time-Series Output Format . The 2026.0.0 release introduces a new GeoPackage based time-series output format, similar to the GPKG time-series output by TUFLOW when linked to the EPA-SWMM engine. The time-series GeoPackage format can be activated by specifying “GPKG” in the time-series output format command in the TCF: . Time Series Output Format == GPKG . This format has multiple advantages over the default csv based files: . | All the data is in a single file making it easier to move around without losing part of the information. | The GIS objects can be symbolised based on the values in the current timestep. This means the styling can be setup to vary temporally, allowing for more effective visualisation of the results. | The files can be loaded into the TUFLOW Viewer inside of QGIS or ArcGIS Pro. ArcGIS Pro does not require an add-on and time-series results can be plotted with the native ArcGIS Pro tools. | Quicker to load large files into the TUFLOW Viewer. | . The GPKG time-series files can be loaded and queried with PyTUFLOW with the TPC, GPKG1D, GPKG2D, or GPKGRL classes. The image below shows time-series results for one of the TUFLOW example models where the pipes are coloured based on the discharge. The objects (points, lines, or polygons) can be symbolised with any of the tools in the chosen GIS including size, colour, and symbol. Groundwater Moisture Outputs Use Consistent Naming . The groundwater moisture outputs have been renamed in the output files to \"GW Moisture (relative)\". The details are as follows: . | Map output data type - the \"GWm\" map output result type has been renamed in the output from \"GW Moisture\" to \"GW Moisture (relative)\". | PO point data type - the \"GWm\" po result type has been renamed in the output from \"GW capacity fraction\" to \"GW Moisture (relative)\". | . Groundwater Vertical Flux Outputs . Two new map output datasets have been added that represent the flux (flow of water) and cumulative flux between vertical groundwater layers. For groundwater layer #1, this represents the infiltration volume. For other layers, it is the flow entering the layer from the layer above. These output datasets are superior to the CI (Cumulative Infiltration) dataset because it is not limited to single layer models without groundwater movement. The new map output data types are: . | GW_QZ: Groundwater Volume Flux per Unit Area | GW_QZI: Groundwater Volume Flux Cumulative per Unit Area | . More information can be found in the TUFLOW User Manual. HEC-DSS Now Supports Paired Curves . TUFLOW now supports reading non-time-series curves stored as “paired data” from HEC-DSS files for rating curves or other non-timed data. Paired curves are accessed the same as time-series curves as described in the TUFLOW User Manual. Example of a rating curve stored in a HEC-DSS file. Improved Approach for TUFLOW-SWMM Automatic Inlets . An improved approach has been added for how TUFLOW-SWMM handles inlets that have been assigned as “AUTOMATIC”. The previous approach, prior to 2026.0.0, estimated the direction of flow entering the inlet. If 85% of the flow was from a single direction, on-grade was used, otherwise on-sag was used. The new approach simply computes both the on-sag and on-grade discharges and applies the larger one. The previous method was considered experimental and backward compatibility has not been provided. Accompanying the new approach, a new TUFLOW-SWMM GPKG time-series output data type has been added: “Inlet OnGrade Duration Percent” that reports the cumulative percentage that an inlet applies the on-grade discharge and is only written if automatic inlets exist. On-grade inlets should be reviewed to make sure that the street cross-section, local depressions, and longitudinal slopes are correct as these impact on-grade inlets, while on-sag inlets are driven by water levels rather than these design features. It is also important that on-grade inlet connected cells span the full approach flow path width. This can be confirmed by reviewing simulation outputs with the 1d_to_2d check file. The figure below shows the result from a simple test model with a single pit on a steep road with a downstream blockage. As the flood progresses, the blockage downstream causes water to back up and eventually water starts to pond at the inlet. The same model was run three times, modelling the pit as an on-sag, on-grade, and automatic inlet type. | Early in the simulation, the flow is shallow and fast moving and the automatic inlet uses on-grade calculations. This can be seen as the on-grade and automatic curves align at the start. | At about 6 hours, the automatic inlet switches to on-sag due to the increased depth of water at the inlet. | The on-sag curve seemingly becomes dominant at about 4 hours. The delay in the automatic case switching to on-sag is due to the increase in flow capture early on, meaning the on-sag approach doesn’t become dominant until later in the automatic simulation. | . Discharges for on-grade, on-sag and automatic inlets for theoretical street with downstream blockage New TUFLOW-SWMM Nodal Datasets . TUFLOW-SWMM models now include additional nodal output data types in the GPKG time-series output file: . | Inlet Inflow Duration - The duration (hours) that there is positive flow from the 2D domain into the node through an inlet. Non-inlet nodes are not represented. | Inlet Surcharge Duration - The duration (hours) that there is surcharging (negative flow reported in Flow from 2D) from the node into the 2D domain for nodes connected to inlets. Non-inlet nodes are not represented. | Inlet OnGrade Duration Percent (only written if inlets with “Automatic” approach exist) - The cumulative percentage that an inlet functions as on-grade compared to on-sag. | . Plot of \"Flow from 2D\" (blue) and \"Inlet Inflow Duration\" (orange secondary axis) for inlet node. Modelling Surcharge with Q Pit and Negative y-Q Curve . ESTRY “Q” type pits now support different depth vs discharge relationships for draining conditions and surcharging conditions. To do this, users should define a negative portion within the existing discharge curve. See image below for an example. The logic for using the discharge curve is as follows: . | When the water level in the 1D pit node exceeds the water level in the 2D, the difference between the levels is now used to search the negative portion of the depth vs discharge curve. | When the water level in the 1D pit node is lower than the pit intake level or the 2D water level, the positive portion of the depth vs discharge curve is used. | . Defining negative head difference vs negative discharge relationship is optional. If a negative portion does not exist in the curve, the surcharge is processed as per the previous TUFLOW releases prior to the 2026.0.0 release i.e. the positive portion of the depth-discharge curve is used for both draining and surcharging conditions. Example of negative head difference vs negative discharge relationship for surcharging Q pits. Enhancement of Form Loss Calculation with Rotated Mesh . Internal testing has identified that the head loss due to the form loss defined by 2d_lfcsh and 2d_bg layers can become underestimated when the hydraulic structure is rotated against the 2D mesh. The 2026.0.0 release implements an enhancement to solve the issue using the following command: . Form Loss Rotational Adjustment == &#123; ON &#125; | OFF . Note, this new option is now the default in the 2026.0.0 release. To revert to the previous method, the above command should be set to “OFF”. HPC Infiltration Drying Approach == Method C . The 2026.0.0 release has made a minor enhancement to the HPC infiltration drying approach and incremented the new method name to “Method C”. This new method has been set as the new default in the 2026.0.0 release: . HPC Infiltration Drying Approach == &#123; Method C &#125; . The drying depth in the new approach has been set to 0.0001 m below the wetting depth, but this can also be set by the user. See Set Cell Drying Depth below for more details. Set Cell Drying Depth . The existing “Cell Wet/Dry Depth” command has been modified to accept a second argument to define the drying depth. For example: . Cell Wet/Dry Depth == 0.002, 0.001 . The above command sets the wetting depth to 0.002 m, and sets the drying depth to 0.001 m. Note, the default drying depth will be set to 0.0001 m below the wetting depth if a second argument is not provided. Using a smaller drying depth can trap marginal volume of water on 2D cells, but it could also improve the stability of direct rainfall models with/without SGS. Downgrades HPC Non-Newtonian Mixing Exponent Error . ERROR 2565 has been downgraded to a WARNING if the HPC Non-Newtonian Mixing Exponent exceeds 10. Note, ERROR 2565 is still triggered if the exponent is less than 0 (zero). Write XMDF Files Using HDF5 Library . TUFLOW now writes XMDF outputs by utilising the HDF5 library directly rather than through the intermediary XMDF library. This change allows the use of the most up-to-date HDF5 library. The generated files should be equivalent. Opt-In Option to Use GDAL Library to Read and Write Some Raster (Grid) Formats . Beta Functionality . TUFLOW now has the option to read and write some raster files using the GDAL Library. A primary driver for this functionality is that it supports raster formats such as tiled GeoTIFF files that previously could not be read. For more information, refer to the TUFLOW User Manual. This functionality is enabled using the following command: . Use GDAL == ON | &#123; OFF &#125; . For outputs, currently only the TIF and GPKG map output formats are supported with the GDAL drivers. GDAL supports format specific configuration options that control settings such as compression, tiling and storage behaviour. These options apply only when rasters are written using GDAL (Use GDAL == ON). The following command can be used to specify creation options for a particular raster format. If TUFLOW writes outputs in multiple raster formats, the command may be used multiple times (one for each format). GDAL Raster Create Options == &#60;raster_format&#62; | &#60;creation_options&#62; . The &lt;raster_format&gt; is the name of the GDAL driver that is used to write the raster, and not the name of the output in TUFLOW. For example, GTiff should be used as this is the GDAL driver name for GeoTIFFs and not TIF. This does not affect the Map Output Format command, which should still use TIF. The example below sets several creation options for TIF outputs: it sets the compression method to use ZSTD and sets the format to use tiling rather than strips. More details on these options can be found on the GeoTIFF GDAL driver page. GDAL Raster Create Options == GTIFF | COMPRESS=ZSTD;TILED=YES . In addition, GDAL support expands the available options for defining the model projection via the existing “TIF Projection” command. When GDAL is enabled (Use GDAL == ON), the projection may be specified as a filename (existing behaviour), or using any of the input formats supported by GDAL’s OGRSpatialReference::SetFromUserInput() function (e.g. EPSG codes). Refer to the GDAL Documentation for a list of all available options. TIF Projection == /path/to/geotiff | &#60;GDAL_option&#62; . As an example, the following command can be used to set the TIF projection for the TUFLOW tutorial model: . TIF Projection == EPSG:32760 As this is beta functionality, some changes may occur in future versions. Downgrades HPC Non-Newtonian Mixing Exponent Error . 2026.0 release downgrades ERROR 2565 to WARNING, if any HPC Non-Newtonian Mixing Exponent exceeds 10. Note that ERROR is still produced for exponent less than 0 (zero). ",
