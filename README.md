# tuflow.github.io

The project serves as the root to https://docs.tuflow.com

Please don't modify this project manually or directly unless it's absolutely urgent. Keep in mind that this project is supposed to only contain copies of built `docs` folders from `bookdown` projects, or similar tools.

If you have a `bookdown` manual that you want to upload, please refer to the private repo https://github.com/TUFLOW/docs_copy for more information. If you don't have the access you require, please contact Jaap van der Velde, or the APAC IT admin Roland Schmid for urgent assistance when Jaap is not available. 

## Structure
