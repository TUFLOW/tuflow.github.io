    "content": "TUFLOW Viewer - Support for TUFLOW-SWMM Results . Major Feature . Support for the new GPKG time-series output format (_swmm_ts.gpkg) has been added and can be loaded via: . | Load Results (via the TLF or TCF) | Load Results - Time Series | . For more information on the format please visit the TUFLOW Wiki: TUFLOW Viewer - GPKG_Time_Series_Format . TUFLOW Viewer - Support for NetCDF Rasters in Animation Tool . Major Feature . Support for NetCDF rasters (including high-resolution NC outputs) has been added to the animation export tool. The rasters must be loaded via Load Results - NetCDF Grid . TUFLOW Viewer - New Option to Copy Results Before Loading . Major Feature . The option to create a temporary copy of the results before loading has been added. This negates the issue of locked result files while trying to view results while TUFLOW is running. This is applicable for XMDF, DAT, and NetCDF results. For more information, please visit the following TUFLOW wiki page: TUFLOW Viewer - Loading Results While TUFLOW is Running . TUFLOW Viewer - Selecting 1D Nodes Does No Longer Affects 1D Long Sections . Selecting 1D nodes while plotting a 1D long section no longer affects the long section (i.e. cause it to disappear). TUFLOW Viewer - Unchecking a Mesh Result in the Layers Panel No Longer Causes Result to be Deselected . Unchecking a mesh layer (e.g. XMDF) in the QGIS Layers Panel will no longer deselect the result in TUFLOW Viewer in the ‘Open Results’ widget. This was previously implemented because there was a bug in QGIS that would cause results to remain visible even after they were deselected in TUFLOW Viewer due to the F7 styling panel ‘Live Update’ option overriding TUFLOW Viewer (to fix this the Open Results widget was linked to the checked layer visibility). Import Empty - Adds Missing Tooltips . Missing tooltip for the 2d_wrf type added. TUFLOW Context Menu - GPKG Time Series Result Styling . Major Feature . Styling by different result types has been added to the GPKG time-series result context menu. This is possible regardless of whether the layer has been opened via TUFLOW Viewer or opened in QGIS natively. Load Layers From TCF - Commands Where No Files Were Loaded Are Now Reported . Commands that should have layers loaded but don’t, are now reported to the user. Processing Toolbox - SWMM Tools . Major Feature . A toolbox containing a number of tools for TUFLOW-SWMM model building has been added. For more information please visit the following TUFLOW wiki page: TUFLOW QGIS Plugin . Processing Toolbox - MiTools . Major Feature . A toolbox containing a number of ported MiTools has been added. Processing Toolbox - Create TUFLOW Project Missing Commands . Missing commands from the TCF has been added to the control file templates created when running the Create TUFLOW Project tool. The missing commands were: . | Start Time == | End Time == | Timestep == | Log Folder == | Output Folder == | Write Check Files == | . Processing Toolbox - Import Empty Supports Empty Folder or Project Folder . The import empty toolbox tool now supports the empty directory to be either the project directory (TUFLOW folder) or the empty directory itself. If using the project directory, the directory structure must match the standard TUFLOW structure. ",

The “About” menu now has several useful links including: . | A link to the TUFLOW Plugin wiki documentation | A link to this changelog | A link to the TUFLOW downloads webpage | . Arch Bridge Editor - Cross-Section Settings . Cross-section settings have been added similar to the bridge settings. Launch TUFLOW Runner . Major Feature . The TUFLOW runner is now bundled with the QGIS plugin and can be launched from the “Run” menu. The TUFLOW Runner manages a queue of TUFLOW and TUFLOW FV simulations running them as simulations finish and resources are available. The runner supports scenarios and events as long as they use the standard naming conventions (~s1~, ~s2~, etc for scenarios and ~e1~,etc for events). The scenarios and events used for a specific tcf file are remembered for the next time simulations are added to the queue. The queue can be reordered to manage priorities and running simulations can be terminated as needed. Reload Layer - Reload All Selected Layers . The reload layer tool now reloads all selected layers in the Layers Panel rather than just the what QGIS sees as the ‘active layer’. SWMM Junction Nodes to Storage Nodes . A tool has been added to convert SWMM junction nodes at HX connections to storage nodes (typically embankment culverts). Storage nodes are recommended in this situation because HX 2D cells do not represent storage so the storage needs to be represented in the connected 1D node. This configuration also provides improved model stability. SWMM Convert - XPSWMM Hydrology Processing Tool . Portions of the SWMM hydrology data can be exported from XPSWMM as an EPA SWMM file (which can be read in as a GeoPackage file), GIS nodal data (which contains most of the parameters), and GIS subcatchments. This tool uses the GIS subcatchments to match up the nodal subcatchment data and add it as extra columns to the EPA SWMM GeoPackage subcatchments layer. These attributes can then be copied to the relevant parameters. SWMM GeoPackage Layers Replace Features (from right click menu) . A right-click item has been added to replace the features in a layer with another layer with compatible geometry and attributes. Because TUFLOW-SWMM GeoPackage files are managed as a group of layers rather than individual layers, it is often desired to replace the features from a layer with another layer. This is particularly true after running some of the processing tools. The field values are copied based on field names. SWAN GIS Tools . The plugin has been updated to use the latest version of the SWAN GIS tools (v0.0.5). SWAN GIS Tools - Date Format . The Model Builder date format has been updated to enforce the use of “dd/mm/yyyy” regardless of system settings. SWAN GIS Tools - Support for Linux and Mac OS . SWAN GIS Tools have been updated to support Linux and Mac OS builds. ",

TUFLOW Viewer now supports the ability to import FV tide boundary data and plot the resulting water level time series and long plot. SWMM Processing Tools - Convert XPSWMM Model from XPX Autofixes for Unsupported BC Configurations . Major Feature . XPSWMM models allow boundary configurations that are not supported by TUFLOW-SWMM. For the configurations below, this tool will make the configurations conform to TUFLOW-SWMM requirements by adding additional nodes and dummy conduits. The modified configurations are hydraulically equivalent. | Nodes with BC inflows and 2D connections are not allowed in TUFLOW-SWMM. The inflow is shifted to a new node which is connected by a dummy conduit. | Outfall nodes with BC inflows are not allowed and are handled the same as case #1. | OUtfall nodes connected to HX boundaries (typically only occur for open channel 1D network connected laterally to the floodplain) are not allowed in TUFLOW-SWMM. In this case, a new node is placed at the outfall location and the outfall is shifted. The outfall is connected to the new node using a dummy conduit. | . The figure below shows an example of changes that occur for outfall nodes that both have an inflow assigned and are connected to HX boundaries (laterally) and SX boundaries (flowing out of the outfall). The fix involves creating two new nodes. One node is created at the original location and the other is created offset to receive the inflow. The outfall node is shifted and reconnected to the SX boundary. The junction at the original location maintains its connection to the HX boundaries. ARR to TUFLOW - ARR Version 4.2 Climate Change Updates . Major Feature . The ARR to TUFLOW tool now uses the latest climate change methodology in ARR Guidelines v4.2.

Can occur when there are a lot of channels on the same path that contain side channels that share the same upstream and downstream node but are defined by different lines. A “timeout” option has been added so that the tool will bail out if it starts hanging for too long when generating the long plots. The timeout time can be set by the user. A “recursion limit” has also been added to stop the tool from hanging by limiting the number of branches a particular path can go down before it short circuits and moves onto the next path. ",

The tool will first search for QML files that contain a geometry extension (_P, _L, _R) before falling back to finding a standard match. Example: . Input layer: 2d_po_001_L.shp . The tool will first search for a QML file with the name 2d_po_L.qml before searching for 2d_po.qml. For more information on customising styles, please see the following wiki page: wiki.tuflow.com/QGIS_TUFLOW_Styles . SWMM Processing Tools - BC - Convert Non-Outfall SX Connections to HX . New processing tool that converts SX connections to non-outfall nodes to HX connections as required by TUFLOW-SWMM. This tool is especially useful after converting a model from XPSWMM or similar that uses SX connections at these nodes. SWMM Processing Tools - Convert - XPSWMM Model from XPX (beta) . Major Feature . Beta Functionality . This tool converts a model from XPSWMM to TUFLOW-SWMM using an xpx file and the TUFLOW tcf file from the XPSWMM simulation. The xpx file can be exported from the XPSWMM application or using the free XPSWMM Viewer. The TUFLOW tcf file is generated when the model is run (analyze from XPSWMM) and is in the “2D\\Data” folder unless custom folders were specified. The output of the tool is a TUFLOW-SWMM model with links to the SWMM inp file. The tool documentation includes more details on how to use the tool. SWMM Processing Tools - Scenarios - Extract from GPKGs . This tool converts multiple standalone TUFLOW-SWMM GeoPackage files into a series of files represented by scenarios generating a common GPKG and one for each scenario. The scenario GPKG files only contain new or modified features from the common GPKG. This makes it easy to see what changes between scenarios and to modify common features without having to change every scenario. This tool also creates a text file with the commands to read the correct input files (inp) by scenario. SWMM Processing Tools - Minor Change to the Tool Outfalls - Fix Multiply Connected Links . SWMM does not allow multiple links to connect to the same outfall node. This tool fixes such issues by moving the outfall node and creating a new conduit connecting the original node to the new outfall. Instead of creating a rectangular channel, this tool now uses a dummy channel instead. This eliminates any energy losses or attenutation that may occur when using a rectangular channel. ARR to TUFLOW - Adds New Methods For Estimating Initial Losses &lt; 60 min . New methods have been added for calculating/estimating initial losses for storm durations less than 60 minutes. This includes interpolating the pre-burst depth values to zero at 0 min (as opposed to the initial loss). Log-linear interpolation methods have been added for both the loss and pre-burst interpolation methods as well. The new methods are listed below, for more information please visit the ARR to TUFLOW TUFLOW Wiki page. | Log-interpolate to zero - will use a log-linear interpolation (duration will use a log scale) (assuming a loss value of 0 mm for 0 min) | Interpolate pre-burst - will linearly interpolate pre-burst depths (rather than losses) (assuming a depth of 0 mm for 0 min) | Log-Interpolate pre-burst - will use a log-linear interpolation on the pre-burst depths (duration will use a log scale) (assuming a depth of 0 mm for 0 min) | . ARR to TUFLOW - Adds Option to Use Design Burst Temporal Pattern Number for Preburst . A new option “design burst” has been added for complete storm generation that will use the same temporal pattern number for the pre-burst that is being used for the design burst. For more information please visit the ARR to TUFLOW TUFLOW Wiki page. ARR to TUFLOW - Handles Missing ARF Parameter Data . If the ARR datahub download is missing ARF parameter data, the tool will no longer error and will continue with the assumption that the ARF = 1.0. A warning will be added to the output log file. Processing Toolbox - Create TUFLOW Project Now Creates “Project Home” in Browser . The Create TUFLOW Project tool will now create the “Project Home” shortcut in the Browser panel. Processing Toolbox - Convert TUFLOW Model GIS Format Supports “Explode Multi-Part Features” Option . The Convert TUFLOW Model GIS Format tool now supports a user setting to explode multi-part features into separate features. Prior to v3.12 this would be on by default with no option to change it. In v3.12 the default has been changed to off. Import Empty - Adds New Empty Tooltips . Adds tooltip for: . | 2d_cyc | 2d_ad_ic | 2d_ad_md | 2d_sa_po | 2d_strm | . ",

This shows users where the tool is being slow at loading (usually large DEMs). Load Layers From TCF - Automatic TUFLOW Styling . Imported layers are automatically given TUFLOW styling. Load Layers From TCF - Grouping Options . An option has been added to give users the ability to choose whether to bring in layers ‘grouped’ or ‘ungrouped’ by control file. Sort / Filter Open Layers - Improved Sorting Algorithm . The sorting algorith has been altered slightly so that layers with the same name (w/o ‘_L’, ‘_P’, ‘_R’ suffix) will be sorted by geometry in order of points, line, polygon. The tool’s speed at sorting layers has also been improved. Convert TUFLOW Model GIS Format - Restrict Conversion by Scenario . Provides user with the option to restrict conversion by scenario name. Configure TUFLOW Project - New Icon . New icon and added to toolbar. TUFLOW Layer Styling - Adds Missing Styles . Added styling for 2d_qnl layers. TUFLOW Utilities - Auto Find 2dm . TUFLOW to GIS will automatically find the 2dm file if using a post-processed XMDF. ",

    "content": "TUFLOW Viewer - Support For Reloading Mesh Layers . Major Feature . Support reloading of mesh layers (must use reload layer tool if results have changed otherwise QGIS crashes). This is only available in QGIS 3.28+. TUFLOW Viewer - Updating Mesh Styling Updates Both Temporal and Maximums . Changing rendering style of a result type will now also change the style of the maximum and minimum type of the same name (and visa versa). Previously this would not update both as QGIS treats these as separate datasets. TUFLOW Viewer - Increase Hover Over Labelling Speed . Increased hover over labelling speed. From testing 10,000 point dataset: previously each label took ~1.0s to calculate and render, now ~0.15s. TUFLOW Viewer - Add Missing Plot Result Type Axis Labels and Uniots . Adds units and label to y-axis for RFR, RFC, RFML outputs. TUFLOW Viewer - Cross-Section Results Can Use Water Level or Max Water Level . Adds ‘Water Level’ and ‘Max Water Level’ result types to cross-section (previous had to use time series ‘Level’ result type). Arch Bridge Editor . Major Feature . New tool - Arch Bridge Editor or ‘BArch’ types. For more information please visit the following TUFLOW wiki page: QGIS TUFLOW Arch Bridge Editor . ARR to TUFLOW - Point Temporal Patterns . The tool will now download the point temporal pattern CSV manually if no temporal patterns are found in the ARR_Web_Data.txt. ARR to TUFLOW - CSV Output Includes Event ID . The processed rainfall CSV files now contain the temporal pattern event ID. This makes it easier to match the processed data to the raw temporal pattern data from the Datahub. Import Empty - GPKG Database Settings Saved . The GPKG ‘Spatial Database Options’ settings are now saved after the tool is run so that they are auto populated the next time the tool is used. Reload Layer - Reload Mesh Support . Major Feature . Updated to support mesh layers in QGIS 3.28+. Load Layers From TCF - Improved Progress Bar . The progress bar has been improved and made more robust. Load Layers From TCF - Support Any TUFLOW Control Selection . Adds support for any TUFLOW control file to import from. Convert Model GIS Format - Manually Assigning CRS . Adds ability to specify output CRS. The output CRS is assigned to all layers when converting formats, however no translation/warping is performed. Convert Model GIS Format - Commands That Do Not Copy Anything Reported . Tool will now log commands that do not convert/copy any files (but should do). Convert Model GIS Format - Create Empty Files . Adds option to create empty files for the converted model. The tool will try and locate an existing ‘empty’ folder or ‘gis’ folder to put the created empty folder, however the user can also specify a relative path (from the root directory i.e. ‘TUFLOW’ folder to place it). Convert Model GIS Format - Custom Output GPKG Name . Adds option to specify the output GPKG database name when using a grouped profile. Toolbox - TMO to Points . Major Feature . Added ‘TMO to Points’ algorithm to the TUFLOW toolbox. This tool converts outputs from a .tmo output (Map Output Format == TMO) into a point vector layer. ",

Support added for saving/loading default styling for vectors using streamline and flow trace styling. TUFLOW Viewer - TUFLOW FV NetCDF Output Renders Velocity Maximums . A workaround has been added for TUFLOW FV NetCDF results so that velocity maximums are rendered properly. TUFLOW Viewer - Adds (xs) and (nwk) to Hydraulic Table Result Types . 1D hydraulic result types add “(xs)” or “(nwk)” at front of result types to indicate what part in the 1d_ta_tables_check.csv the property came from (either from the cross-section processing or from the channel network processing). TUFLOW Viewer - Adds Axis Labels for 1D Hydraulic Tables . Axis labels have been added for 1D hydraulic table plotting. TUFLOW Viewer - Adds Option to Flip Secondary Axis . Major Feature . The option to flip which axis has the secondary axis applied has been added to the plot context menu (i.e. the secondary axis can be either for the x-axis or y-axis). TUFLOW Viewer - Animation Default Format Changed to MP4 . The default output file format for the animation tool has been changed from avi to mp4. TUFLOW Viewer - Better Error Handling for FFMPEG Downloader . Better error handling and reporting has been implemented when TUFLOW Viewer tries to download ffmpeg.exe for animation creation. TUFLOW Viewer - Adds Result Name to Filename for Cross-Section Batch Plot Exporter . The result name is added to the exported filename for batch export cross-section plot. This is the same (existing) behaviour when batch export time-series plots. TUFLOW Viewer - Support For Changing the Reference Time for NetCDF Raster Results . Support has been added to change the reference time for NetCDF rasters. Results must be loaded via Load Results - NetCDF Grid. TUFLOW Viewer - Open Result Widget Communicates with Layers Panel Visibility . The “Open Results” widget is now linked with the Layer Styling panel so that when results are deselected in TUFLOW Viewer the layer is simultaneously unchecked in the Layers Panel (and visa-versa). This has been implemented as there can be conflict between the QGIS F7 styling panel and TUFLOW Viewer (the QGIS panel is overriding TUFLOW Viewer) when results are deselected. Load Layers from TCF - Better Error Handling . Better error handling for issues occuring when trying to load layers from TCF into QGIS. TUFLOW Layer Styling - Adds Missing Layer Styling . Missing default TUFLOW layer styling has been added for bg_uvpt_check. TUFLOW Utilities - Adds Breakline Function to Common Functions . The ASC_to_ASC.exe utility breakline function is now available in the ‘Common Functions’ tab. TUFLOW Utilities = Adds ASC_to_ASC Version Number . The ASC_to_ASC.exe version number is presented in the lower left of the dialog. This is important as the new GIS formats are only available in 2023 releases (or later) of the tool. The version is found when the TUFLOW Utilities dialog is initially loaded and is based on the asc_to_asc.exe path in the ‘Executables’ tab. TUFLOW Utilities - Adds New Output Format Options to ASC_to_ASC Dialog . New formats added to the dialog for ASC_to_ASC.exe ‘Common Functions’. Increment Layer - Adds New GPKG Option to Save Superseded Version Out . A new option to save the superseded GPKG layer out into a new database. This prevents the necessity of creating a copy of a GPKG each time a layer is incremented. For more information, please visit the following TUFLOW wiki page: Increment Layer - Save Layer Into Superseded Folder . Configure Project - Dialog Will No Longer Close on Error .

Once imported, the boundary feature can be selected from the input GIS layer (e.g. 2d_bc, 2d_sa) and plotted using the Time Series plot and selecting an appropriate result type. The boundary input type requires a unique ID to be able to link the check file with the feature (i.e. HQ boundaries do not work as these are automatically generated and do not use the ID attribute). Link to TUFLOW Wiki Documentation: TUFLOW Viewer - Import 2D BC Tables . TUFLOW Viewer - User Defined Time Formatting in Animation Export . Major Feature . The animation export now supports user defined time formatting for the time label. The format follows the Python time formatting convention as described at the following link: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes . TUFLOW Viewer - Flood Modeller Result Shown on Cross-Sections With the Same Name . Flood modeller results can now be shown on cross-section even if they don’t intersect the created PLOT_P points if they have the same name as a result node. ReFH2 to TUFLOW - Support for FEH2022 Rainfall . Major Feature . The FEH2022 rainfall model is now supported in the RefH2 to TUFLOW tool. TUFLOW Plugin Downloader - Copy Path to Clipboard Button . Adds button to the finish dialog that will copy the download path to the clipboard (so that it can easily be pasted into the “Install from ZIP” plugin installation option). Import Empty - Missing Empty Types Added for Tooltips . Adds new/missing empty types to the empty tooltips (2d_bg, 1d_bg, 1d_lc). TUFLOW Context Menu - Layers Panel . Major Feature . Adds a “TUFLOW” context menu when a layer is right-clicked in the Layers Panel. The provided options are dependent on the selected layer (e.g. if it is a SHP or GPKG, or some layers get extra commands like the messages_P output). The tools below have been added to the context menu options. Increment Layer (Context Menu) . Major Feature . Beta Functionality . Adds a new increment layer tool to the layer context menu. Similar to the existing increment layer tool however the dialog will be different depending on the option selected in the context menu. By adding context to the dialog, the available options in the increment tool can be limited and the dialog will be far less complicated and busy. E.g. depending on the format, the options will be: . | SHP option - Increment File | GPKG option - Increment Layer and Database (create a new GPKG to increment layers into) | GPKG option - Increment Layer (increment layer inside the existing GPKG) | . And the resulting dialog will be dependent on the selected option. Filter Messages by ID . Major Feature . Adds Filter Message by ID to the TUFLOW context menu for messages_P layers. Copy TUFLOW Command . Major Feature . Adds ‘Copy TUFLOW Command’ tool to TUFLOW context menu. This tool will create a TUFLOW command based on the GIS layer name. From the layer name, the command and control file it belongs in will be inferred. The tool will do a search for the control file within the directory structure (based on the GIS file location), otherwise if the control file is not found, the standard location of the control file will be used. Multiple layers can be selected at once. If applicable, the command will be combined to a single line (e.g. for 2d_zsh) else separate commands will be created with line breaks. TUFLOW Utilities - GPKG Raster Support . GPKG rasters now available and supported in the relevant ‘Common Functions’ drop down boxes. Load Layers From TCF - Support for Old Auto Estry Command . Older style ‘ESTRY Control File AUTO’ syntax now supported (previously only ‘ESTRY Control File == AUTO’ worked). Apply GPKG Layer Names - Support for GPKG Rasters . GPKG rasters now supported. TUFLOW Layer Styling - Support ccA_L Result File . _ccA_L result file now has default styling. ARR to TUFLOW - Support for LIMB Data . Major Feature . Option add to process and use LIMB data will if available. ARR to TUFLOW - Remove Longitude Limit . Removes longitude limit (&gt;153.2999). Previously this limit was in place as data was missing beyond this point. Increment Layer - User Check Before Overwriting Existing Layers . Adds user check when overwriting an existing layer in a GPKG. Import Empty (Processing Toolbox) . Major Feature . Beta Functionality . A new version of the import empty tool has been added to the TUFLOW processing toolbox. This has been done as this is probably the correct location for the import empty tool and also allows a spring clean to remove legacy code and backward compatibility to old QGIS versions. Create Project (Processing Toolbox) . Major Feature . Beta Functionality . A new version of the Create TUFLOW Project tool has been added to the TUFLOW processing toolbox. This has been done as this is probably the correct location for this tool and also allows a spring clean to remote legacy code and backward compatibility to old QGIS versions. ",
