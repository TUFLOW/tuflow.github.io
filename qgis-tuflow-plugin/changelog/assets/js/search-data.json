For more information on the format please visit the TUFLOW Wiki: TUFLOW Viewer - GPKG_Time_Series_Format . Support for NetCDF Rasters in Animation Tool . Support for NetCDF rasters (including high-resolution NC outputs) has been added to the animation export tool. The rasters must be loaded via Load Results - NetCDF Grid . New Option to Copy Results Before Loading . The option to create a temporary copy of the results before loading has been added. This negates the issue of locked result files while trying to view results while TUFLOW is running. This is applicable for XMDF, DAT, and NetCDF results. For more information, please visit the following TUFLOW wiki page: TUFLOW Viewer - Loading Results While TUFLOW is Running . Selecting 1D Nodes Does No Longer Affects 1D Long Sections . Selecting 1D nodes while plotting a 1D long section no longer affects the long section (i.e. cause it to disappear). Unchecking a Mesh Result in the Layers Panel No Longer Causes Result to be Deselected . Unchecking a mesh layer (e.g. XMDF) in the QGIS Layers Panel will no longer deselect the result in TUFLOW Viewer in the ‘Open Results’ widget. This was previously implemented because there was a bug in QGIS that would cause results to remain visible even after they were deselected in TUFLOW Viewer due to the F7 styling panel ‘Live Update’ option overriding TUFLOW Viewer (to fix this the Open Results widget was linked to the checked layer visibility). Import Empty . Adds Missing Tooltips . Missing tooltip for the 2d_wrf type added. TUFLOW Context Menu . GPKG Time Series Result Styling . Styling by different result types has been added to the GPKG time-series result context menu. This is possible regardless of whether the layer has been opened via TUFLOW Viewer or opened in QGIS natively. Load Layers From TCF . Commands Where No Files Were Loaded Are Now Reported . Commands that should have layers loaded but don’t, are now reported to the user. Processing Toolbox . SWMM Tools . A toolbox containing a number of tools for TUFLOW-SWMM model building has been added. For more information please visit the following TUFLOW wiki page: TUFLOW QGIS Plugin . MiTools . A toolbox containing a number of ported MiTools has been added. Create TUFLOW Project Missing Commands . Missing commands from the TCF has been added to the control file templates created when running the Create TUFLOW Project tool. The missing commands were: . | Start Time == | End Time == | Timestep == | Log Folder == | Output Folder == | Write Check Files == | . Import Empty Supports Empty Folder or Project Folder .

The “About” menu now has several useful links including: . | A link to the TUFLOW Plugin wiki documentation | A link to this changelog | A link to the TUFLOW downloads webpage | . Arch Bridge Editor . Cross-Section Settings . Cross-section settings have been added similar to the bridge settings. Launch TUFLOW Runner . The TUFLOW runner is now bundled with the QGIS plugin and can be launched from the “Run” menu. The TUFLOW Runner manages a queue of TUFLOW and TUFLOW FV simulations running them as simulations finish and resources are available. The runner supports scenarios and events as long as they use the standard naming conventions (~s1~, ~s2~, etc for scenarios and ~e1~,etc for events). The scenarios and events used for a specific tcf file are remembered for the next time simulations are added to the queue. The queue can be reordered to manage priorities and running simulations can be terminated as needed. Reload Layer . Reload All Selected Layers . The reload layer tool now reloads all selected layers in the Layers Panel rather than just the what QGIS sees as the ‘active layer’. SWMM Junction Nodes to Storage Nodes . A tool has been added to convert SWMM junction nodes at HX connections to storage nodes (typically embankment culverts). Storage nodes are recommended in this situation because HX 2D cells do not represent storage so the storage needs to be represented in the connected 1D node. This configuration also provides improved model stability. SWMM Convert - XPSWMM Hydrology Processing Tool . Portions of the SWMM hydrology data can be exported from XPSWMM as an EPA SWMM file (which can be read in as a GeoPackage file), GIS nodal data (which contains most of the parameters), and GIS subcatchments. This tool uses the GIS subcatchments to match up the nodal subcatchment data and add it as extra columns to the EPA SWMM GeoPackage subcatchments layer. These attributes can then be copied to the relevant parameters. SWMM GeoPackage Layers Replace Features (from right click menu) . A right-click item has been added to replace the features in a layer with another layer with compatible geometry and attributes. Because TUFLOW-SWMM GeoPackage files are managed as a group of layers rather than individual layers, it is often desired to replace the features from a layer with another layer. This is particularly true after running some of the processing tools. The field values are copied based on field names. SWAN GIS Tools . The plugin has been updated to use the latest version of the SWAN GIS tools (v0.0.5). Date Format . The Model Builder date format has been updated to enforce the use of “dd/mm/yyyy” regardless of system settings. Support for Linux and Mac OS . SWAN GIS Tools have been updated to support Linux and Mac OS builds. ",

Convert - XPSWMM Model from XPX Autofixes for Unsupported BC Configurations . XPSWMM models allow boundary configurations that are not supported by TUFLOW-SWMM. For the configurations below, this tool will make the configurations conform to TUFLOW-SWMM requirements by adding additional nodes and dummy conduits. The modified configurations are hydraulically equivalent. | Nodes with BC inflows and 2D connections are not allowed in TUFLOW-SWMM. The inflow is shifted to a new node which is connected by a dummy conduit. | Outfall nodes with BC inflows are not allowed and are handled the same as case #1. | OUtfall nodes connected to HX boundaries (typically only occur for open channel 1D network connected laterally to the floodplain) are not allowed in TUFLOW-SWMM. In this case, a new node is placed at the outfall location and the outfall is shifted. The outfall is connected to the new node using a dummy conduit. | . The figure below shows an example of changes that occur for outfall nodes that both have an inflow assigned and are connected to HX boundaries (laterally) and SX boundaries (flowing out of the outfall). The fix involves creating two new nodes. One node is created at the original location and the other is created offset to receive the inflow.

Note: the utilities downloader already used these settings and does not require updating. Note: the TUFLOW plugin does not handle any of the proxy settings directly, rather it utilises QGIS API to make requests. TUFLOW Viewer . Import FV Tide BC NetCDF - Option to use Local Time . The option to use local time has now been added to the import dialog. Previously this would always default to on. The timezone is also now appended to the name in the result widget within TUFLOW Viewer. Toolbox . Create TUFLOW Project . Adds a template powershell run stript run.ps1 to the template control files. 1D Integrity Tool . New Advanced Options For Flow Trace Long Plots . The following options have been added to try and prevent the tool from hanging when there are a large number of channel branching in the network which creates a large number of ‘paths’. Can occur when there are a lot of channels on the same path that contain side channels that share the same upstream and downstream node but are defined by different lines. A “timeout” option has been added so that the tool will bail out if it starts hanging for too long when generating the long plots. The timeout time can be set by the user. A “recursion limit” has also been added to stop the tool from hanging by limiting the number of branches a particular path can go down before it short circuits and moves onto the next path. ",

    "content": "TUFLOW Styling . Support Geometry Specific QML Styling . Adds support for users to update the default TUFLOW styling by adding geometry specific QML files. The tool will first search for QML files that contain a geometry extension (_P, _L, _R) before falling back to finding a standard match. Example: . Input layer: 2d_po_001_L.shp . The tool will first search for a QML file with the name 2d_po_L.qml before searching for 2d_po.qml. For more information on customising styles, please see the following wiki page: wiki.tuflow.com/QGIS_TUFLOW_Styles . SWMM Processing Tools . BC - Convert Non-Outfall SX Connections to HX . New processing tool that converts SX connections to non-outfall nodes to HX connections as required by TUFLOW-SWMM. This tool is especially useful after converting a model from XPSWMM or similar that uses SX connections at these nodes. Convert - XPSWMM Model from XPX (beta) . This tool converts a model from XPSWMM to TUFLOW-SWMM using an xpx file and the TUFLOW tcf file from the XPSWMM simulation. The xpx file can be exported from the XPSWMM application or using the free XPSWMM Viewer. The TUFLOW tcf file is generated when the model is run (analyze from XPSWMM) and is in the “2D\\Data” folder unless custom folders were specified. The output of the tool is a TUFLOW-SWMM model with links to the SWMM inp file. The tool documentation includes more details on how to use the tool. Scenarios - Extract from GPKGs . This tool converts multiple standalone TUFLOW-SWMM GeoPackage files into a series of files represented by scenarios generating a common GPKG and one for each scenario. The scenario GPKG files only contain new or modified features from the common GPKG. This makes it easy to see what changes between scenarios and to modify common features without having to change every scenario. This tool also creates a text file with the commands to read the correct input files (inp) by scenario. Minor Change to the Tool Outfalls - Fix Multiply Connected Links . SWMM does not allow multiple links to connect to the same outfall node. This tool fixes such issues by moving the outfall node and creating a new conduit connecting the original node to the new outfall. Instead of creating a rectangular channel, this tool now uses a dummy channel instead. This eliminates any energy losses or attenutation that may occur when using a rectangular channel. ARR to TUFLOW . Adds New Methods For Estimating Initial Losses &lt; 60 min . New methods have been added for calculating/estimating initial losses for storm durations less than 60 minutes. This includes interpolating the pre-burst depth values to zero at 0 min (as opposed to the initial loss). Log-linear interpolation methods have been added for both the loss and pre-burst interpolation methods as well. The new methods are listed below, for more information please visit the ARR to TUFLOW TUFLOW Wiki page. | Log-interpolate to zero - will use a log-linear interpolation (duration will use a log scale) (assuming a loss value of 0 mm for 0 min) | Interpolate pre-burst - will linearly interpolate pre-burst depths (rather than losses) (assuming a depth of 0 mm for 0 min) | Log-Interpolate pre-burst - will use a log-linear interpolation on the pre-burst depths (duration will use a log scale) (assuming a depth of 0 mm for 0 min) | . Adds Option to Use Design Burst Temporal Pattern Number for Preburst . A new option “design burst” has been added for complete storm generation that will use the same temporal pattern number for the pre-burst that is being used for the design burst. For more information please visit the ARR to TUFLOW TUFLOW Wiki page. Handles Missing ARF Parameter Data . If the ARR datahub download is missing ARF parameter data, the tool will no longer error and will continue with the assumption that the ARF = 1.0. A warning will be added to the output log file. Processing Toolbox . Create TUFLOW Project Now Creates “Project Home” in Browser . The Create TUFLOW Project tool will now create the “Project Home” shortcut in the Browser panel. Convert TUFLOW Model GIS Format Supports “Explode Multi-Part Features” Option . The Convert TUFLOW Model GIS Format tool now supports a user setting to explode multi-part features into separate features. Prior to v3.12 this would be on by default with no option to change it. In v3.12 the default has been changed to off. Import Empty . Adds New Empty Tooltips . Adds tooltip for: . | 2d_cyc | 2d_ad_ic | 2d_ad_md | 2d_sa_po | 2d_strm | . ",

Adds support for the raw ZZN time series output from Flood Modeller (Load Results - Time Series FM). SCS to TUFLOW . New Approach to Use GIS Polygons . New approach added that uses GIS polygon(s) and their attribute data for method calculation. This has the benefit of allowing multiple calculations to take place and spatial distribution of parameters. For more information, please visit the following TUFLOW wiki page: QGIS SCS to TUFLOW - GIS Approach . Load Layers From TCF . Progress Bar . A progres bar has been added. This shows users where the tool is being slow at loading (usually large DEMs). Automatic TUFLOW Styling . Imported layers are automatically given TUFLOW styling. Grouping Options . An option has been added to give users the ability to choose whether to bring in layers ‘grouped’ or ‘ungrouped’ by control file. Sort / Filter Open Layers . Improved Sorting Algorithm . The sorting algorith has been altered slightly so that layers with the same name (w/o ‘_L’, ‘_P’, ‘_R’ suffix) will be sorted by geometry in order of points, line, polygon. The tool’s speed at sorting layers has also been improved. Convert TUFLOW Model GIS Format . Restrict Conversion by Scenario . Provides user with the option to restrict conversion by scenario name. Configure TUFLOW Project . New Icon . New icon and added to toolbar. TUFLOW Layer Styling . Adds Missing Styles . Added styling for 2d_qnl layers. TUFLOW Utilities . Auto Find 2dm .

Support reloading of mesh layers (must use reload layer tool if results have changed otherwise QGIS crashes). This is only available in QGIS 3.28+. Increase Hover Over Labelling Speed . Increased hover over labelling speed. From testing 10,000 point dataset: previously each label took ~1.0s to calculate and render, now ~0.15s. Add Missing Plot Result Type Axis Labels and Uniots . Adds units and label to y-axis for RFR, RFC, RFML outputs. Cross-Section Results Can Use Water Level or Max Water Level . Adds ‘Water Level’ and ‘Max Water Level’ result types to cross-section (previous had to use time series ‘Level’ result type). Arch Bridge Editor . New tool - Arch Bridge Editor or ‘BArch’ types. For more information please visit the following TUFLOW wiki page: QGIS TUFLOW Arch Bridge Editor . ARR to TUFLOW . Point Temporal Patterns . The tool will now download the point temporal pattern CSV manually if no temporal patterns are found in the ARR_Web_Data.txt. CSV Output Includes Event ID . The processed rainfall CSV files now contain the temporal pattern event ID. This makes it easier to match the processed data to the raw temporal pattern data from the Datahub. Import Empty . GPKG Database Settings Saved . The GPKG ‘Spatial Database Options’ settings are now saved after the tool is run so that they are auto populated the next time the tool is used. Reload Layer . Reload Mesh Support . Updated to support mesh layers in QGIS 3.28+. Load Layers From TCF . Improved Progress Bar . The progress bar has been improved and made more robust. Support Any TUFLOW Control Selection . Adds support for any TUFLOW control file to import from. Convert Model GIS Format . Manually Assigning CRS . Adds ability to specify output CRS. The output CRS is assigned to all layers when converting formats, however no translation/warping is performed. Commands That Do Not Copy Anything Reported . Tool will now log commands that do not convert/copy any files (but should do). Create Empty Files . Adds option to create empty files for the converted model. The tool will try and locate an existing ‘empty’ folder or ‘gis’ folder to put the created empty folder, however the user can also specify a relative path (from the root directory i.e. ‘TUFLOW’ folder to place it). Custom Output GPKG Name . Adds option to specify the output GPKG database name when using a grouped profile. Toolbox . TMO to Points . Added ‘TMO to Points’ algorithm to the TUFLOW toolbox.

Support for Saving Default Vector Styles for Streamlines and Flow Traces . Support added for saving/loading default styling for vectors using streamline and flow trace styling. TUFLOW FV NetCDF Output Renders Velocity Maximums . A workaround has been added for TUFLOW FV NetCDF results so that velocity maximums are rendered properly. Adds (xs) and (nwk) to Hydraulic Table Result Types . 1D hydraulic result types add “(xs)” or “(nwk)” at front of result types to indicate what part in the 1d_ta_tables_check.csv the property came from (either from the cross-section processing or from the channel network processing). Adds Axis Labels for 1D Hydraulic Tables . Axis labels have been added for 1D hydraulic table plotting. Adds Option to Flip Secondary Axis . The option to flip which axis has the secondary axis applied has been added to the plot context menu (i.e. the secondary axis can be either for the x-axis or y-axis). Animation Default Format Changed to MP4 . The default output file format for the animation tool has been changed from avi to mp4. Better Error Handling for FFMPEG Downloader . Better error handling and reporting has been implemented when TUFLOW Viewer tries to download ffmpeg.exe for animation creation. Adds Result Name to Filename for Cross-Section Batch Plot Exporter . The result name is added to the exported filename for batch export cross-section plot. This is the same (existing) behaviour when batch export time-series plots. Support For Changing the Reference Time for NetCDF Raster Results . Support has been added to change the reference time for NetCDF rasters. Results must be loaded via Load Results - NetCDF Grid. Open Result Widget Communicates with Layers Panel Visibility . The “Open Results” widget is now linked with the Layer Styling panel so that when results are deselected in TUFLOW Viewer the layer is simultaneously unchecked in the Layers Panel (and visa-versa). This has been implemented as there can be conflict between the QGIS F7 styling panel and TUFLOW Viewer (the QGIS panel is overriding TUFLOW Viewer) when results are deselected. Load Layers from TCF . Better Error Handling . Better error handling for issues occuring when trying to load layers from TCF into QGIS. TUFLOW Layer Styling . Adds Missing Layer Styling . Missing default TUFLOW layer styling has been added for bg_uvpt_check. TUFLOW Utilities . Adds Breakline Function to Common Functions . The ASC_to_ASC.exe utility breakline function is now available in the ‘Common Functions’ tab. Adds ASC_to_ASC Version Number . The ASC_to_ASC.exe version number is presented in the lower left of the dialog. This is important as the new GIS formats are only available in 2023 releases (or later) of the tool. The version is found when the TUFLOW Utilities dialog is initially loaded and is based on the asc_to_asc.exe path in the ‘Executables’ tab. Adds New Output Format Options to ASC_to_ASC Dialog . New formats added to the dialog for ASC_to_ASC.exe ‘Common Functions’. Increment Layer . Adds New GPKG Option to Save Superseded Version Out . A new option to save the superseded GPKG layer out into a new database. This prevents the necessity of creating a copy of a GPKG each time a layer is incremented. For more information, please visit the following TUFLOW wiki page: Increment Layer - Save Layer Into Superseded Folder . Configure Project . Dialog Will No Longer Close on Error . The dialog will no longer close if an error occurs while running the Configure TUFLOW Project tool. ",

    "content": "TUFLOW Viewer . Support for 2d_bc_tables_check.csv . TUFLOW Viewer now supports loading and viewing the 2d_bc_tables_check.csv file. Once imported, the boundary feature can be selected from the input GIS layer (e.g. 2d_bc, 2d_sa) and plotted using the Time Series plot and selecting an appropriate result type. The boundary input type requires a unique ID to be able to link the check file with the feature (i.e. HQ boundaries do not work as these are automatically generated and do not use the ID attribute). Link to TUFLOW Wiki Documentation: TUFLOW Viewer - Import 2D BC Tables . User Defined Time Formatting in Animation Export . The animation export now supports user defined time formatting for the time label. The format follows the Python time formatting convention as described at the following link: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes . Flood Modeller Result Shown on Cross-Sections With the Same Name . Flood modeller results can now be shown on cross-section even if they don’t intersect the created PLOT_P points if they have the same name as a result node. ReFH2 to TUFLOW . Support for FEH2022 Rainfall . The FEH2022 rainfall model is now supported in the RefH2 to TUFLOW tool. TUFLOW Plugin Downloader . Copy Path to Clipboard Button . Adds button to the finish dialog that will copy the download path to the clipboard (so that it can easily be pasted into the “Install from ZIP” plugin installation option). Import Empty . Missing Empty Types Added for Tooltips . Adds new/missing empty types to the empty tooltips (2d_bg, 1d_bg, 1d_lc). TUFLOW Context Menu - Layers Panel . Adds a “TUFLOW” context menu when a layer is right-clicked in the Layers Panel. The provided options are dependent on the selected layer (e.g. if it is a SHP or GPKG, or some layers get extra commands like the messages_P output). The tools below have been added to the context menu options. Increment Layer (Context Menu) . Adds a new increment layer tool to the layer context menu. Similar to the existing increment layer tool however the dialog will be different depending on the option selected in the context menu. By adding context to the dialog, the available options in the increment tool can be limited and the dialog will be far less complicated and busy. E.g. depending on the format, the options will be: . | SHP option - Increment File | GPKG option - Increment Layer and Database (create a new GPKG to increment layers into) | GPKG option - Increment Layer (increment layer inside the existing GPKG) | . And the resulting dialog will be dependent on the selected option. Filter Messages by ID . Adds Filter Message by ID to the TUFLOW context menu for messages_P layers. Copy TUFLOW Command . Adds ‘Copy TUFLOW Command’ tool to TUFLOW context menu. This tool will create a TUFLOW command based on the GIS layer name. From the layer name, the command and control file it belongs in will be inferred. The tool will do a search for the control file within the directory structure (based on the GIS file location), otherwise if the control file is not found, the standard location of the control file will be used. Multiple layers can be selected at once. If applicable, the command will be combined to a single line (e.g. for 2d_zsh) else separate commands will be created with line breaks. TUFLOW Utilities . GPKG Raster Support . GPKG rasters now available and supported in the relevant ‘Common Functions’ drop down boxes. Load Layers From TCF . Support for Old Auto Estry Command . Older style ‘ESTRY Control File AUTO’ syntax now supported (previously only ‘ESTRY Control File == AUTO’ worked). Apply GPKG Layer Names . Support for GPKG Rasters . GPKG rasters now supported. TUFLOW Layer Styling . Support ccA_L Result File . _ccA_L result file now has default styling. ARR to TUFLOW . Support for LIMB Data . Option add to process and use LIMB data will if available. Remove Longitude Limit . Removes longitude limit (&gt;153.2999). Previously this limit was in place as data was missing beyond this point. Increment Layer . User Check Before Overwriting Existing Layers . Adds user check when overwriting an existing layer in a GPKG. Processing Toolbox . Import Empty (Processing Toolbox) . A new version of the import empty tool has been added to the TUFLOW processing toolbox. This has been done as this is probably the correct location for the import empty tool and also allows a spring clean to remove legacy code and backward compatibility to old QGIS versions. Create Project (Processing Toolbox) . A new version of the Create TUFLOW Project tool has been added to the TUFLOW processing toolbox. This has been done as this is probably the correct location for this tool and also allows a spring clean to remote legacy code and backward compatibility to old QGIS versions. ",
